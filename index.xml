      <title>NSF GRFP</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/nsf-grfp/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/nsf-grfp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a ton of general information online about the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship, so I won&amp;rsquo;t go into many details here. For a large, high-quality collection of advice and past examples across fields, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship&#34;&gt;Alex Lang&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for folks interested in statistics/data science/AI applied to public health, a couple more tailored insights may be valuable. For context: I applied for the GRFP during my senior year of undergrad (fall of 2019). I am now entering my fifth and final year of a PhD program in Biostatistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;to-what-extent-should-i-focus-on-public-health-in-my-application&#34;&gt;To what extent should I focus on public health in my application?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part of the GRFP solicitation that can trip people up is the section on &amp;ldquo;Ineligible areas of study&amp;rdquo; and the related section on &amp;ldquo;Limited exceptions to ineligible research&amp;rdquo;. Here are some text excerpts from 2024:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. &amp;ldquo;Individuals are not eligible to apply if they will be enrolled in graduate study focused on clinical practice, counseling, social work, patient-oriented research, epidemiological and medical behavioral studies,
outcomes research (interventions, treatment, or therapies), and health services research. Ineligible study
includes pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, and behavioral interventions for physical or mental disease
or disorder, prophylaxis, diagnosis, therapy, or treatment. Research to provide evidence leading to a
scientific basis for consideration of a change in health policy or standard of care is not eligible. Graduate
study focused on community, public, or global health, or other population-based research including
medical intervention trials is also not eligible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii. &amp;ldquo;For applicants applying to degree programs in engineering, mathematical, physical, computer or
information sciences disciplines, research with disease- or health-related goals (e.g., etiology-, diagnosis-,
or treatment-related) that &lt;strong&gt;advance fundamental knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; in engineering, mathematical, physical,
computer or information sciences, is eligible for support.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is: &lt;em&gt;what is an appropriate balance between focusing on health vs the fundamental knowledge&lt;/em&gt;? Some advice I was given while applying was to keep in mind that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have a lot of funding and their own graduate fellowship(s), so you have to make the case that NSF should care about your work in this ecosystem. When I was writing my application, I tried to emphasize the statistical questions / proposed contributions, using the public health question(s) as motivation throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-application-materials&#34;&gt;My application materials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a concrete example, &lt;a href=&#34;./ConsidineEM_GRFP_Research_Proposal.pdf&#34;&gt;here is my research proposal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional context, &lt;a href=&#34;./ConsidineEM_GRFP_application_review.pdf&#34;&gt;here are the reviews  I received&lt;/a&gt;, which also provide some documentation of my CV at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-similar-is-my-dissertation-to-my-grfp-proposal-from-5-years-ago&#34;&gt;How similar is my dissertation to my GRFP proposal from 5 years ago?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As emphasized throughout GRFP advice forums, this fellowship invests in the person, not the project. For a sense of how much your ideas can change / be refined (especially if you are applying as an undergrad), I encourage you to read the abstract of &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36623253/&#34;&gt;my first dissertation paper&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally based on my GRFP research proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the rest of my dissertation falls under the umbrella of statistics/data science for environmental health (consistent with the goals stated throughout my GRFP application), the topics of my second and third papers are quite different than my GRFP research proposal, in part because they explore methodological areas that I was unfamiliar with / unaware of before starting grad school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, as long as you genuinely represent your goals, your specific research ideas can (and likely will!) evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching Fellow for Graduate-Level Biostatistics Courses</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/project/tf/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/project/tf/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are descriptions of the three full-semester courses that I helped teach at HSPH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spring-2024-bst-226-applied-longitudinal-analysis&#34;&gt;Spring 2024: BST 226, Applied Longitudinal Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approx. number of students: 100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Course description: This course covers modern methods for the analysis of repeated measures, correlated outcomes and longitudinal data, including the unbalanced and incomplete data sets characteristic of biomedical research. Topics include an introduction to the analysis of correlated data, analysis of response profiles, fitting parametric curves, covariance pattern models, random effects and growth curve models, and generalized linear models for longitudinal data, including generalized estimating equations (GEE) and generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fall-2023-bst-210-applied-regression-analysis&#34;&gt;Fall 2023: BST 210, Applied Regression Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approx. number of students: 75&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Course description: Topics include model interpretation, model building, and model assessment for linear regression with continuous outcomes, logistic regression with binary outcomes, and proportional hazards regression with survival time outcomes. Specific topics include regression diagnostics, confounding and effect modification, goodness of fit, data transformations, splines and additive models, ordinal, multinomial, and conditional logistic regression, generalized linear models, overdispersion, Poisson regression for rate outcomes, hazard functions, and missing data. The course provides students with the skills necessary to perform regression analyses and to critically interpret statistical issues related to regression applications in the public health literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fall-2021-bst-222-basics-of-statistical-inference&#34;&gt;Fall 2021: BST 222, Basics of Statistical Inference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approx. number of students: 75&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Course description: This course provides a basic yet thorough introduction to the probability theory and mathematical statistics that underlie many of the commonly used techniques in public health research. Topics covered include probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson), means, variances and expected values, finite sampling distributions, parameter estimation (method of moments, maximum likelihood), confidence intervals, hypothesis testing (likelihood ratio, Wald and score tests). All theoretical material are motivated with problems from epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health and other public health areas. This course is aimed towards second year doctoral students in fields other than Biostatistics. Background in algebra and calculus required.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the roles I undertook as Vice-President of the Harvard graduate student science policy group was co-organizing a series of events at the intersection of climate &amp;amp; health. This brought together students and staff from across the Harvard School of Public Health, Medical School, Dental School, and Graduate School of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences. In particular, I spearheaded and moderated a panel and networking dinner focused on the translation of research into policy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hugoblox.com&#34;&gt;Hugo Blox Builder&lt;/a&gt; is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this page, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:&lt;/p&gt;


    
    &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2vj0WcvH5c?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;
      &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bilibili&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; bilibili id=&amp;quot;BV1WV4y1r7DF&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your &lt;code&gt;assets/media/&lt;/code&gt; media library or in your &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/&#34;&gt;page&amp;rsquo;s folder&lt;/a&gt;, and then embedding them with the &lt;em&gt;video&lt;/em&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; video src=&amp;quot;my_video.mp4&amp;quot; controls=&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;podcast&#34;&gt;Podcast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page&amp;rsquo;s folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the &lt;em&gt;audio&lt;/em&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; audio src=&amp;quot;ambient-piano.mp3&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out:&lt;/p&gt;








  








&lt;audio controls &gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/teaching/js/ambient-piano.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;test-students&#34;&gt;Test students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the &lt;code&gt;spoiler&lt;/code&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;spoiler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;👉 Click to view the solution&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;You found me!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;spoiler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary class=&#34;cursor-pointer&#34;&gt;👉 Click to view the solution&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;rounded-lg bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-800 p-2&#34;&gt;
    You found me 🎉
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;flex px-4 py-3 mb-6 rounded-md bg-primary-100 dark:bg-primary-900&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;pr-3 pt-1 text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-300&#34;&gt;
  &lt;svg height=&#34;24&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; stroke-width=&#34;1.5&#34; d=&#34;m11.25 11.25l.041-.02a.75.75 0 0 1 1.063.852l-.708 2.836a.75.75 0 0 0 1.063.853l.041-.021M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0a9 9 0 0 1 18 0m-9-3.75h.008v.008H12z&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;dark:text-neutral-300&#34;&gt;We wrap the LaTeX math in the Hugo Blox &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;strong&gt;math block&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo Blox Builder utilises Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. The code theme can be selected in the &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```python

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hugoblox.com&#34;&gt;Hugo Blox Builder&lt;/a&gt; is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this page, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:&lt;/p&gt;


    
    &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2vj0WcvH5c?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;
      &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bilibili&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; bilibili id=&amp;quot;BV1WV4y1r7DF&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your &lt;code&gt;assets/media/&lt;/code&gt; media library or in your &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/&#34;&gt;page&amp;rsquo;s folder&lt;/a&gt;, and then embedding them with the &lt;em&gt;video&lt;/em&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; video src=&amp;quot;my_video.mp4&amp;quot; controls=&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;podcast&#34;&gt;Podcast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page&amp;rsquo;s folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the &lt;em&gt;audio&lt;/em&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; audio src=&amp;quot;ambient-piano.mp3&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out:&lt;/p&gt;








  








&lt;audio controls &gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/teaching/python/ambient-piano.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;test-students&#34;&gt;Test students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the &lt;code&gt;spoiler&lt;/code&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;dark:text-neutral-300&#34;&gt;We wrap the LaTeX math in the Hugo Blox &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo Blox Builder utilises Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. The code theme can be selected in the &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```python
import pandas as pd

      <title>Zooming Out -- On Sustainability, Social Justice, and Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The threat of climate change has been a driving motivation for both my professional and personal choices for many years. In practice, this has manifested as getting into the weeds with various academic subjects (i.e. air quality, statistics, public health, computer science) as well as recurrent introspection on many aspects of lifestyle. This spring, I was reminded of the importance of picking my head up and seeking out new perspectives &amp;ndash; despite the countless hours I&amp;rsquo;ve spent educating myself on environmental and social/economic justice topics, there is always more to learn and consider. In this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll share some broad reflections from several recent experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the ideas here were inspired by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reading the book &lt;em&gt;Regenesis: Feeding the World Without Devouring the Planet&lt;/em&gt; (2022), by George Monbiot, and discussing in the Harvard graduate student Science Policy Group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serving as a Review Editor for the US&amp;rsquo; Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5), facilitating the incorporation of comments from public and peer review on the Western Wildfires Focus Box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attending the annual Health Effects Institute (HEI) Conference, specifically the sessions entitled &amp;ldquo;Exploring the Link Between Air Pollution and Health in High Pollution Environments&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Addressing Air Pollution and Climate Change with Shared Solutions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitating or listening in on various climate and/or air quality-related webinars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appreciating-the-complexity&#34;&gt;Appreciating the complexity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt;, in particular, was a powerful reminder of how multifaceted our global environmental + social justice challenges are. While at this point in my academic career, I rarely encounter truly novel information about air pollution or its impacts on public health, I was struck by how many fundamental things I did not know about our global food system &amp;ndash; on topics ranging from soil, plants, water, and their interactions with each other and with the atmosphere, to the many ways in which antibiotics, toxic metals, and microplastics are introduced to various stages of our food production, to the countless perverse financial incentives affecting farmers worldwide, to the degree of corporate monopoly / oligopoly not only in agrochemicals but also in the overall supply / trade of food. The list goes on, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the previous paragraph mostly being about problems, my favorite thing about &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt; was its balance: between problems and solutions, between narrative and traditional nonfiction, between breadth and depth, between science and philosophy. One of the most compelling (and generalizable) sections was a discussion of modern complex systems. Monbiot (the author) illustrates how there is a tradeoff between pursuing efficiency and maintaining resilience: basically, while standardization, just-in-time delivery, and strong interconnectedness between nodes (companies, regions, etc.) all make sense for each individual actor at the time of implementation, they also facilitate cascading failure when something goes wrong at any place in the system. Think global supply chain issues during Covid, the financial crisis of 2008, etc. This comparison is even more apt given the increasing coupling of the financial sector with the global food system. While the concepts of diversification and redundancy are not at all new, I found that Regenesis effectively shone a spotlight on how our current food system is particularly vulnerable to cascading failure (with deadly consequences for people in low-income countries or circumstances), especially in the context of climate change. The main takeaway, echoed in other recent seminars / experiences, is that while individual action is important, what is really needed to ward off system-level failure are system-level safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reasons-for-optimism&#34;&gt;Reasons for optimism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s critiques which felt particularly relevant to me (as a current grad student) was directed at modern academia: &amp;ldquo;A tremendous body of knowledge accumulates, but the walls between disciplines are high. In science, modularity is dangerous.&amp;rdquo; This year, participating in the preparation of the US NCA5 gave me a rare view of what fully bringing together and bridging scientific disciplines can look like. The National Climate Assessment is a large report, produced approximately every five years, summarizing the current and future impacts of climate change on the US. It is written by more than 300 experts, spanning disciplines ranging from forest ecology to urban planning. For the NCA5, a new element is the inclusion of &amp;ldquo;focus boxes&amp;rdquo;, or short chapters on topics that touch many other disciplines: compound events (disasters), Covid-19, risks to supply chains, blue carbon, and western wildfires. Other developments of the NCA5 (in contrast to previous assessments) were an increased focus on adaptation in addition to mitigation and both acknowledgement and discussion of environmental justice in every chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, sitting in a conference hall filled with the authors of the NCA5, listening to presentations (both scientific and activist * ) at the HEI conference as well as other climate change-related seminars, and reading &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt; were all positive reminders of how many smart, caring people are dedicating their lives to figuring out how to solve our pressing environmental / societal challenges. This is not to say that it feels in any way inevitable that everything will turn out alright &amp;ndash; there is a tremendous amount of work yet to be done, much of it in translating the science into regulatory, industrial, and social reform. But I feel more hopeful than I have in a while. And I imagine that by reading this, you might too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an example of actions being taken to fight environmental injustice, one of the most memorable presentations at the HEI conference was by GreenRoots, a community-based organization started in Chelsea, MA. Despite its close proximity to Boston, Chelsea (which is majority-racial minority) has much higher levels of pollution, mostly due to the high density of industrial facilities sited in and near the community. Check out a list of GreenRoots&amp;rsquo; recent successes here. But don&amp;rsquo;t forget to come back to this blog &amp;ndash; the most important section is below!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;re-examining-techno-centrism&#34;&gt;Re-examining techno-centrism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt;, I looked up some critiques of the book, to see what aspects might be reasonably contested. I&amp;rsquo;ve included the links to the most credible at the end of this blog. The following recommendations made by Monbiot appear to be somewhat universal among environmentalists (who care about human welfare) with regards to the global food system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dramatically shift our diets to rely less on animal products and highly-processed sugars/carbohydrates (the latter more for public health reasons)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize our use of water and farm chemicals, relying on organic interventions where necessary to enhance fertility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research and develop a high-yield &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fao.org/agroecology/overview/en/&#34;&gt;agroecology&lt;/a&gt;, including deepening our understanding of different kinds of soil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break global corporations&amp;rsquo; grip on the food chain and diversify the global food system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monbiot then goes on to make the following recommendations, which are the target of some critique:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit the land we use to feed humanity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop farming animals entirely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the protein and fat from animals with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gfi.org/resource/precision-fermentation-and-cellular-agriculture/&#34;&gt;precision fermentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewild the land released from farming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Monbiot also puts a lot of emphasis on numeracy, shifting the discourse about food and its production to be less aesthetic and more practical, and wherever possible using scientific &amp;ldquo;understanding of complex systems to trigger cascading change&amp;rdquo;. While I was reading the book, Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s suggestions all made a lot of sense to me. But some of the critiques I later read helped me to zoom out even farther, identifying some of my own blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most salient critiques of Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s whole platform is that despite his calls for strong antitrust laws and restraint of intellectual property regarding precision fermentation, history and current movements by major corporations indicate that oligopoly control of this new technology has relatively high likelihood. Using his own logic about increasingly-standardized nodes in complex systems, critics argue that although precision fermentation is less vulnerable to climate change than crops and animals living outdoors, it is still exposed to the capriciousness of the financial sector. My personal take (acknowledging that this is not my field of expertise and I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about it for more than a couple of months) is that if precision fermentation is what it takes to save humanity&amp;rsquo;s existence on Earth in the short run, then we will have time to figure out everything else (e.g. economic inequality) in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I also acknowledge the broader critique of Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s platform: that it is very techno-centric. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocentrism&#34;&gt;Techno-centrism&lt;/a&gt;, or the belief that technology can address all environmental / ecological problems, has long been debated in the context of climate change. Historically, a lot of the buzz surrounded carbon capture as a possible solution to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. (The current scientific consensus is that while carbon capture can help us with the &amp;ldquo;last mile&amp;rdquo;, it is not cost-effective for counteracting the vast majority of emissions.) But this is only one example of holding technology up as a silver bullet to fix environmental degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unherd.com/2022/11/the-truth-about-eco-fascism/&#34;&gt;One of the critiques&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt; articulated an important point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The question you ask will frame the philosophy you develop. If your question is &amp;lsquo;how can we remove all this atmospheric carbon to avoid what these computer models say is coming?&amp;rsquo; then the answer can only lead you to a globalized technocracy. If, on the other hand, the question you ask is &amp;lsquo;how can we build lives which offer us meaning, in alliance with the rest of nature?&amp;rsquo; then you may be led in a very different direction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of this article, Paul Kingsnorth, also posited a broader critique of 21st century environmentalism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you have ever wondered why climate change has so utterly dominated the green debate to the exclusion of so many other problems which stem from industrial society — mass extinction, soil erosion, the collapse of human cultures, ocean pollution — then the answer, I think, is here. Climate change is a problem amenable to numerical questions and technocratic answers. It is, furthermore, a problem which, almost by definition, can only be solved by elites. If you can’t read or understand the &amp;lsquo;peer-reviewed science&amp;rsquo; then you are open to being intimidated into fearful silence by those who can, or claim they can. And those people — drawn, as all green &amp;rsquo;thought leaders&amp;rsquo; are, from the upper strata of society — will bring with them a worldview which treats the mass of humanity like so many cattle to be herded into the sustainable, zero-carbon pen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent my last 3 years in the Biostatistics PhD program at Harvard, the 4 years before that at CU Boulder surrounded by people in STEM, and my childhood in Boulder (one of the most highly-educated cities in America), I am a poster child for Kingsnorth&amp;rsquo;s critique. And while I think the whole &amp;ldquo;treats the mass of humanity like so many cattle to be herded into the sustainable, zero-carbon pen&amp;rdquo; is overly harsh, I see some truth in his point about climate change lending itself more easily to quantitative analysis than many other environmental and societal problems. ** Similarly, environmental (health) statistics research is dominated by questions related to the quality and temperature of the air, rather than other mediums like water or soil, in part because of our ability to use measurements from technologies such as stationary ground-level monitors and satellite imagery to make inferences about broader areas and population exposures, given atmospheric mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, Kingsnorth and several other critics don&amp;rsquo;t seem to care so much about the elevation of climate science and renewable energy research over marine biology or soil science so much as the elevation of formal scientific investigation and technology overshadowing other forms of knowing and interacting with the environment. Several articles expressed concern that although in Regenesis Monbiot describes the importance of personal connection with nature, his recommended solutions might further distance people&amp;rsquo;s feeling of being connected to and dependent on the Earth and non-human species, with negative consequences both for people&amp;rsquo;s pursuit of meaning and concern for the environment. Borrowing one of Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s examples, I personally don&amp;rsquo;t see how a &amp;ldquo;dinosaur nugget&amp;rdquo; whose inner protein is sourced from precision fermentation distances people any more from nature or life meaning than one with protein sourced from chicken born, raised, and slaughtered on a factory farm. But I fully agree with the overarching point that it is important to be guided by diverse, not necessarily quantitative perspectives &amp;ndash; including lower-income, rural, Indigenous, Global South &amp;ndash; in attempting to design a more just and sustainable future for us all. And of course, that it is critical to continue trying to make both quantitative data sets and the groups of people who analyze them more representative of the population at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harmony between these two visions was articulated nicely by someone at the HEI conference, who said that while it&amp;rsquo;s easier to identify hotspots at scale, fixing the hotspots has to happen locally. In other words, while scientists with access to large data sets can help identify things like distributions, trends, or clusters from above, and can make &lt;em&gt;recommendations&lt;/em&gt; for where (and even how) to allocate societal resources to where they are most needed, and technologists can design tools that can be widely used, the ultimate implementation of effective, lasting solutions requires local buy-in and often also local tailoring. One size does not fit all &amp;ndash; even in the case of precision fermentation. Local government, businesses, and community-based organizations have a vital (possibly the most significant) role to play in the pursuit of environmental sustainability and social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-closing&#34;&gt;In closing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed this blog or not, I highly encourage you to go read &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt;! As I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed here, not everyone agrees with Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s perspectives, but being exposed to them and all the research he references is prime fodder for individual reflection and conversations about food, people, nature, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overview of Data Science Tools for Climate &amp; Health</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a pedagogy fellow during AY 2022-2023, I developed this short course for the new online master&amp;rsquo;s in public health program at HSPH.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is one of the most (if not the most) pressing challenges of our time. Meanwhile, data science is a rapidly expanding field; references to the power of “machine learning” are ubiquitous. But what does “machine learning” really mean in the context of public health and climate change? In what situations might a really nice map make advanced statistical analysis gratuitous? This module will help you build a mental framework for distinguishing different aspects of data science and gain intuition for when these tools have the most potential to help us study and fuel action at the intersection of climate and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-objectives&#34;&gt;Learning Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differentiate between major categories of statistical / data science tools: (a) data visualization / mapping, (b) traditional statistical modeling / parametric regression, and (c) machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify areas of climate &amp;amp; health research and/or policy work for which the different types of tools are best suited, possibly in combination or to complement one another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain familiarity with common critiques / drawbacks of these types of tools, specifically at the intersection of climate and health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Statistical Consulting and Learning-Centered Teaching</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/stat-collab-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/stat-collab-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This academic year, I am a pedagogy fellow (PF) at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH). Instead of being a TF/TA for the Biostatistics Department (which typically involves grading, teaching labs and holding office hours for students), I work on developing curriculum and encouraging evidence-based teaching practices, both within my department and for the school overall. For HSPH-wide projects, I collaborate with PFs from other departments. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on insights inspired by my department-specific project as well as by a course on teaching that all the PFs took last semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context: in spring 2020, I really enjoyed taking a course at CU on statistical collaboration. (The Professor, Eric Vance, used the term collaboration as opposed to consulting to emphasize the importance of consistent, two-way communication between statisticians and domain experts.) When I heard that my current department was looking for a PF to redesign our PhD-level statistical consulting course, I applied immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond digging into statistical consulting, being a PF has been a great opportunity to think deeply about whether I want teaching to be a core part of my future career. The upshot on that front is that I&amp;rsquo;m still making up my mind. However, many of the ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve been synthesizing are broadly applicable on both individual and systemic levels, sufficiently so that they merit a post. The three main topics I will discuss are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evidence-based tools in education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key skills common to teaching and consulting / collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broad musings on modern education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evidence-based-tools-in-education&#34;&gt;Evidence-Based Tools in Education&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of Teaching 100 (the course the PFs took last semester), we read the book &lt;em&gt;Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning&lt;/em&gt;. We then proceeded to have eight weeks of discussions, led by instructor Tari Tan, about this material and more. During the class and in the months since, a few concepts in particular have stuck out to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one takeaway from &lt;em&gt;Make it Stick&lt;/em&gt; is that retrieval practice is critical for long-term learning. Retrieval practice is honestly testing your knowledge (as opposed to re-reading material), ideally waiting long enough between practices that you start to forget. Learning both concepts and skills this way is intentionally challenging, but has been shown over and over again to yield better educational outcomes than traditional studying. I was introduced to retrieval practice through studying music (my teacher would have me do practice performances where I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look at the sheet music), but looking back on my academic experience, I think retrieval practice is still under-utilized in most traditional classroom settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related concept is one that many people nowadays are familiar with: the power of cultivating a growth mindset. Despite the proliferation of this idea, STEM education (and math in particular) struggles with deeply-rooted notions that some people are destined to flourish and others are doomed to flail. My personal experience in math classes from middle school through grad school is that it can be really hard to prevent unsuccessful attempts from harming your perception of your overall competence (see &amp;ldquo;Potent Challenges&amp;rdquo; in a past blog post). Taking the time to think deeply about these issues in Teaching 100, I began to wonder whether centering tools like retrieval practice in classrooms (from an early age) and explicitly reinforcing the notion that all meaningful learning is difficult (and therefore must be undertaken iteratively) might boost many people&amp;rsquo;s development of growth mindsets. (Note: it&amp;rsquo;s possible that such a transition in standard educational practice is already somewhat under way, given what my mom said about her experience getting a teaching license several years ago. After all, it&amp;rsquo;s been two decades since I started kindergarten.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third aspect of Teaching 100 that I found especially compelling was active learning. The definition of &amp;lsquo;active learning&amp;rsquo; is very broad, but generally refers to educational activities with more student engagement than just listening to an instructor lecture for 60-90 minutes. While I previously had a somewhat lukewarm perception of the push for active learning (especially in higher education), in Teaching 100 we were presented with evidence that in addition to helping a class of students overall, active learning tends to disproportionately benefit students from marginalized racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. The more I reflect on this, the more it makes sense to me that increasing interaction between students and instructors, encouraging and guiding metacognition (self-reflection), and providing some additional course structure can help narrow educational achievement gaps between those who have received more academic / professional mentorship and those who haven&amp;rsquo;t. Deploying active learning strategies to address inequity in the classroom complements my discussion in &amp;ldquo;Reflections on Privilege in Higher Education&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-skills-common-to-teaching-and-consulting&#34;&gt;Key Skills Common to Teaching and Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my field of study, my thinking about consulting / collaboration is inevitably tied to statistics / data science. However, my sense is that many of these ideas apply much more generally. In fact, reflecting on my experience working to create curriculum for the statistical consulting course, I notice a lot of similarities between best practices taught in Statistical Collaboration and in Teaching 100. I share the most prominent here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy place to start is the importance of &lt;strong&gt;cultivating a welcoming environment&lt;/strong&gt; where people feel respected and are comfortable asking questions and voicing concerns. This is a core tenet both of learning-centered teaching and of building a productive working relationship with a domain expert / statistical consulting client. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into details here, but I believe in the power of both verbal and non-verbal cues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two related practices are an immediate focus on identifying each party&amp;rsquo;s goals / motivations and periodically &lt;strong&gt;ensuring that the work is in alignment with the goals&lt;/strong&gt;. As a statistician, this includes inquiring about what the intended product(s) and audience of a domain expert&amp;rsquo;s study will be, and highlighting any mismatches (as they arise) between the question of interest and available data / methods. As a teacher, this includes clearly articulating the course objectives and learning goals (e.g. in a syllabus) and helping students to align their learning experience with their educational / career goals, for instance through intermittent metacognition / reflection assignments. In both settings, &lt;strong&gt;writing down a clear plan&lt;/strong&gt; at the beginning of the partnership, explicitly laying out expectations and timelines for both productivity and communication between parties, is extremely helpful for getting everyone on the same page and making progress towards both parties&amp;rsquo; goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to clarifying overall goals, a communication strategy that resonates a lot with me for both settings is &lt;strong&gt;leading with intent&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether asking a domain expert a question about their data or assigning students a task, giving a brief explanation of why it matters / what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for often yields better outcomes (e.g., information or students&amp;rsquo; work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially in statistical consulting settings, leading with intent can be used to gracefully assess a domain expert&amp;rsquo;s knowledge of statistics / coding, which then facilitates giving explanations and advice tailored to their level of understanding. In teaching, this is referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;zone of proximal development&lt;/strong&gt;: information and skills that a learner can realistically assimilate into their mental framework in the near term, given what they already know. When starting work in a new area of application, a statistician also must learn on the fly. A technique that we practiced frequently in Statistical Collaboration was to pause after a domain expert&amp;rsquo;s explanation and, instead of immediately moving on to the next thing, &lt;strong&gt;summarize back our understanding&lt;/strong&gt; of what they said. This helps to catch and rectify misconceptions of both the goals and technical details of a project early on, before it becomes burdensome to correct course. Similarly, asking a domain expert or a student to explain out loud (or in writing) what they took away from one of my explanations is a great way to check whether they understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, a big takeaway for me from both Statistical Collaboration and Teaching 100 is that working with other people is so much more effective and enjoyable when one is familiar with well-tested strategies for doing so. Of course, there is always a chance of unforeseen circumstances that require ad hoc responses. But from my experience and countless stories from others, it seems like a large amount of professional stress is predictable and avoided by consistently implementing existing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;broad-musings-about-modern-education&#34;&gt;Broad Musings about Modern Education&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on the theme of interpersonal skills, in Teaching 100 our main project was to design a syllabus for a course, and I noticed that many of us in the class chose topics meant to address the &amp;ldquo;soft side&amp;rdquo; of our technical disciplines, such as statisticians working with domain experts or doctors working with patients. Traditionally, at least in STEM, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been much formal training along these lines. Skills in professional communication and/or teaching are often undervalued (e.g. in academic tenure review) and it is mostly expected that people either mimic their advisors / managers or figure it out on their own through trial and error. Especially given the self-selection of many people who have natural affinity for social interaction into other fields, it makes sense that classroom educators might try to fill this gap more systematically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as medicine in particular seems to have known for a long time, professional interpersonal skills are very difficult to learn in only a classroom setting. But outside the classroom, it is harder for educators to actually observe and guide their students&amp;rsquo; improvement. If the instructor of a statistical consulting course doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the time / compensation to sit through client meetings with every one of their students, then they (and their students) must have a certain amount of confidence in the students&amp;rsquo; skills to venture forth and report back. This becomes less realistic the more students are in the class and/or the more variation in the students&amp;rsquo; skill levels. I have yet to arrive at a conclusion about how best to deal with this tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent events appear to have made interpersonal skills more important than ever. The emergence of tools such as ChatGPT largely level the playing field for many writing-centric tasks, including composition of cover letters. My suspicion is that live interviews and collaboration skills will become ever more important in hiring for professional positions, in addition to promotions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To provide a sense of what I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on other than my research in the National Studies on Air Pollution &amp;amp; Health Group and Earth Lab, here is a list of my most substantial projects that resulted in course papers but not peer-reviewed publications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewed state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigated the usefulness of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for estimating
uncertainty in wildfire smoke prediction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explored methods to deal with measurement error (noise) in longitudinal (correlated) data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used distributed lag nonlinear models to investigate associations between air pollution and mortality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explored the evolution of discourse surrounding global public health surveillance and
information systems, including future opportunities and risks in implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used network methods, spatial and socioeconomic data to model migration between U.S. cities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used data assimilation methods to model seasonal flu cases in Denver, CO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used spatial kriging to improve estimation of air quality from a random forest model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used satellite imagery to analyze trends in air quality over Southeast Asia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used a hierarchical model and change-point analysis to predict energy usage from
temperature in U.S. cities. &lt;em&gt;My model was the class’s most accurate on unseen data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used a convolutional neural network to predict sociodemographic information based on
satellite images of US cities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The Revelatory Mirror of AI/ML -- On Evolution, Uncertainty, and Recourse</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Our successes and failures alike in getting these systems to do &amp;lsquo;what we want,&amp;rsquo; it turns out, offer us an unflinching, revelatory mirror.” - Brian Christian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer, I joined a data science &amp;amp; society-themed book club sponsored by the Harvard Data Science Initiative. Our first book was &lt;em&gt;The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values&lt;/em&gt; by Brian Christian (2020). It turned out to be one of my favorite nonfiction books. Someone in the group also let us know about a free virtual event, the Symposium on Interpretable and Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, hosted by the National Academies of Science Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics, which I ended up attending. (If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this Symposium, a recording is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/06-21-2022/interpretable-and-explainable-ai-and-machine-learning&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the reading, the Symposium, and our book club&amp;rsquo;s weekly discussions, there are a plethora of topics about which I could wax lyrical. For the sake of a bite-sized post, however, I will stick to a few overarching themes that stuck out to me: (1) the development of artificial intelligence (AI) giving us insights into our own brains, (2) the ability (or lack thereof) for individual people or minority groups to pursue justice for maltreatment at the &amp;ldquo;hands&amp;rdquo; of an algorithm, and (3) the perpetual need for humility (for both humans and AI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;similarities-and-differences-between-machine-and-human-learning&#34;&gt;Similarities and Differences Between Machine and Human Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alignment Problem&lt;/em&gt; steps through many key developments in AI, with lots of fun anecdotes to help readers peek behind the publication curtain to see what researchers were thinking and struggling with. This progression really helped me to see why, for instance, animals (including us) require both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations (e.g. hunger and curiosity) to thrive in a variety of environments. I&amp;rsquo;m also now able to articulate both the benefits and potential consequences of imitation: you can learn things that would otherwise be really difficult to explain or craft incentives for, but it may not work out if you attempt to copy something that you&amp;rsquo;re not equipped to do and/or don&amp;rsquo;t understand the motivations for. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to ever surpass the teacher if you&amp;rsquo;re just trying to match them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I see a lot of parallels to my personal experience learning to play the clarinet, which is by far my most structured extended learning experience. When you start out, you cling to the rules (of instrument technique and music in general) for dear life in an attempt to get off the ground: you try to do exactly what your teacher tells you, use a metronome to keep time and a tuner to check pitch. Eventually, it helps to have less of this internal rigidity and to start paying more attention to what feels right, trying to follow the &amp;ldquo;flow&amp;rdquo; of the music. Throughout this process, having a teacher to imitate and/or listening to recordings of other people playing can help you progress by leaps and bounds. At the same time, you likely won&amp;rsquo;t be able to play a piece as quickly or with as great a dynamic range as your teacher, and it will often sound worse if you try to mimic them in these ways right off the bat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cool development in AI has been the emergence of techniques to train AI against themselves, which I eventually recognized as a version of my clarinet teacher&amp;rsquo;s motto that the goal of taking lessons was to become my own best teacher (either in real-time or by recording and then listening to myself). A final memorable example of AI-human similarities in The Alignment Problem detailed how the development of an algorithm that allowed a computer to learn from changes in its expectation about the future (termed Temporal Difference Learning) ended up closely describing how our brains produce dopamine (a &amp;ldquo;happy hormone&amp;rdquo;), which was a huge breakthrough for neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all these similarities, there are also many ways that machine and human learning differ. For instance, &amp;ldquo;saliency&amp;rdquo; methods have shown that when some AI are trying to classify images as dogs or not-dogs, they are often looking at features like the blurriness of the outline of the object/subject in the middle of the image, as opposed to humans tending to look at the overall shape. This causes problems if we want to be able to interpret the output from algorithms: forcing computers to use our ontologies (language/thinking structure) might facilitate our understanding but prevent superhuman inference and/or be stymied by competing human ontologies**.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, regarding the earlier point about Temporal Difference Learning: although encountering observations that conflict with our mental models offers great learning opportunities, people often resist changing our opinions, sometimes even ignoring new data instead of doing the hard cognitive work of updating our expectations. In this way, we probably don&amp;rsquo;t want AI to be too similar to human cognitive behavior. On the flip side, while certain strategies developed for guiding the behavior of AI might be applicable to humans, they may not necessarily be good for us. For example, in the book club we discussed how gamifying various aspects of our lives can in some cases be helpful (e.g. rewarding ourselves for getting work done) but in other cases are harmful (e.g. becoming addicted to video games because they are more immediately satisfying than real life).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;actionable-recourse-for-algorithmic-injustice&#34;&gt;Actionable Recourse for Algorithmic Injustice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last six years, there has been an explosion of research and discussion about algorithmic bias against certain groups of people. Before reading The Alignment Problem, I actually hadn&amp;rsquo;t realized how young this field is because I started college in 2016, so I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about it my whole academic career. Now, in 2022, it seems like there are hundreds of different definitions of algorithmic fairness, along with mathematical theory showing that you can&amp;rsquo;t obtain them all at the same time, except possibly under very specific (unrealistic) conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the really interesting issues that my partner (who just graduated from law school) and I were talking about, and that then came up in the Symposium, is the lack of legal infrastructure for dealing with decisions made (or strongly informed) by algorithms. For instance, the US legal system currently allows appeal for decisions made by a biased jury, but not by a biased algorithm. Financial institutions are somewhat more regulated in how they may use models to inform lending decisions. However, as Patrick Hall (a professor at George Washington University) noted: even if, for instance, people are entitled to some notice of a few key features that factored into why they were denied a loan, this may be wildly insufficient for explaining an individual prediction from a (potentially proprietary) high-dimensional, nonlinear machine learning model that was designed to make the company profits when the results are averaged across all their clients. This is to say, we have a long way to go in truly providing individuals with actionable recourse against algorithms. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more on this topic, I&amp;rsquo;m linking some resources at the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cultivating-uncertainty&#34;&gt;Cultivating Uncertainty(?)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the panel discussion at the Symposium, a common scientific concept was raised: the more independent teams/models arrive at the same conclusion, the more reason to trust in that conclusion. This intuition motivates a general technique that researchers have started using to quantify the uncertainty of AI: generate a lot of results from different models or by perturbing the same model in different ways (e.g. cutting off different parts of the model from contributing to each prediction), and see how similar all the results are to each other. More spread indicates more uncertainty in the model prediction. (Side thought: time will tell whether quantification of model uncertainty ends up playing a role in people&amp;rsquo;s recourse from AI-based decisions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this approach really only works if all the models / sub-models are sufficiently distinct or independent of one another. In &lt;em&gt;The Alignment Problem&lt;/em&gt;, Christian describes how the Effective Altruism movement (see &amp;ldquo;On Having an Impact, Part 1&amp;rdquo;) struggles with maintaining moral uncertainty (i.e. for what global causes to focus attention and resources on) while simultaneously distributing educational resources and encouraging discussion between people all around the world. Similarly, while the push for open science / reproducibility and transparent decision making has many benefits, including increased methodological scrutiny and less duplicated work, it seems that there may be some downsides to encouraging everyone to do things the exact same way, using the exact same tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In data science, for instance, using the same packages in R or Python streamlines analyses, but could also potentially produce less evidence across multiple studies on the same topic because the work is not being done independently. This would of course be most concerning if a commonly-used package had a mistake in it, but even if the methods were all correct, the convenience of using a ready-made package might result in the community missing out on other ways to think about a problem that would provide different insights. Similarly, if the vast majority of publicly available datasets are biased towards white males, a consensus across these datasets is not necessarily a better representation of the population overall. (Note: I&amp;rsquo;m certainly not arguing for a return to siloed and/or poorly documented workflows &amp;ndash; just trying to articulate a point that I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard mentioned as much compared to the huge push for open science.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we thought we had a robust uncertainty estimate, maintaining a heightened sense of humility is especially important for AI because we want to avoid a situation in which the machines are no longer amenable to human input. Private and/or public sector creators of AI systems might also want machines to be even more careful than human actors would be for many practical applications, as they will often be judged more harshly by the public (and potentially, in the future, by the law). For an example of this, I&amp;rsquo;ll draw from &lt;em&gt;The Alignment Problem&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s description of the relationship between uncertainty and impact: if a self-driving car is unsure whether there&amp;rsquo;s a person in the road in front of it, then the best course of action is to slow down so as to minimize adverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize: on her concluding presentation slide at the Symposium, Been Kim (a research scientist at Google Brain) wrote, &amp;ldquo;One of the biggest challenges [in interpreting/explaining AI] is to resist building trust and be skeptical.&amp;rdquo; I believe she meant this in the context of humans interpreting a single model, but the sentiment could also easily be applied to humans interpreting ensembles of dependent models and/or data, as well as to AI continuing to make decisions after being deployed for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am far from being an expert in these topics, but I hope that my rambles have left you with some interesting thoughts and/or whetted your appetite to go learn more from people who&amp;rsquo;ve studied these issues in depth. My overarching takeaways from all of this are that (1) there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of interesting work being done in this field, (2) there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to do to ensure AI systems live up to our ideals, (3) we have the opportunity to learn a lot about ourselves along the way, and (4) as whizzy as our tech gets, humanity will need to stay humble to avoid losing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Principled Negotiation and the Ethos of Public Health</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/public-health-ethos/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/public-health-ethos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently reading a book on negotiation called &lt;em&gt;Getting to Yes&lt;/em&gt;, written by members of the Harvard Negotiation Project. One of the opening chapters describes positional bargaining: two sides starting from places of disagreement and inching their way closer by making small concessions in turn. The authors describe how problematic this process is: it is inefficient, commonly leads to unwise outcomes (good for neither side), and can harm relationships between parties. Instead, the book presents a case for principled negotiation, founded on separating the people (negotiators) from the problem, focusing on interests instead of positions, inventing options for mutual gain, and insisting on use of objective criteria. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/principled-negotiation-focus-interests-create-value/&#34;&gt;Here is a nice summary&lt;/a&gt;, for those interested in learning more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this book up to motivate presentation of my principles. Nearly everything we do in our professional and personal lives is a negotiation of some kind. It is important to establish what we believe so that we can work with others to identify common ground and develop pragmatic solutions to our problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to the news and having conversations with other people, it is clear that there are foundationally diverse beliefs about how human civilization should look, and how we should get there (if the belief is that we aren&amp;rsquo;t already there). I have come to the unoriginal conclusion that the largest discrepancy in how people think and act is described by the weight an individual mentally assigns to their personal freedoms in comparison with the freedoms of others, and to what extent they believe we should rely on governmental authorities to enforce the balance of individuals&amp;rsquo; freedoms. This discrepancy has obvious ties to the arena of public health, where large and complex problems such as infectious diseases and environmental pollution bring tensions between individual freedoms and collective sacrifice to light. In fact, while pondering my beliefs and their implications, I ran across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apha.org/-/media/files/pdf/membergroups/ethics/code_of_ethics.ashx&#34;&gt;Public Health Code of Ethics&lt;/a&gt; by the American Public Health Association (APHA) and determined this to be the most clear articulation of my principles that I have ever found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an excerpt from this Code of Ethics [page 3, bolding is mine], defining what it means for humans to flourish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Flourishing does not focus so much on biological function as on &lt;strong&gt;the social conditions of capability and opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; upon which health itself and many other goods depend. Flourishing refers to what individuals and communities experience when institutional and cultural structures create the opportunity for people to realize a wide range of potential capabilities inherent in all human beings. Flourishing occurs when &lt;strong&gt;capabilities for agency, creativity, intelligence, understanding, emotional engagement, and other positive human potentialities take shape in the form of lives well lived&lt;/strong&gt;. As such, we take a life course perspective that examines public health issues from maternal and child health into old age while &lt;strong&gt;recognizing specific vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt; at the extremes of age. The term human flourishing also underscores the &lt;strong&gt;relational interdependence&lt;/strong&gt; among human beings, which is expressed in virtually all social and cultural activity and fits well with the contemporary understanding of the social determinants of health. &lt;strong&gt;The preconditions of everyone’s health are communal and systemic&lt;/strong&gt;, and the field of public health must address them as such. Human flourishing is thus consonant with a social-relational, rather than an exclusively individualistic, interpretation of key values such as human rights, liberty, equality, and social and environmental justice that play a vital role in contemporary public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposite of human flourishing is&lt;/strong&gt; not only disease or ill health but also domination, inequity, discrimination, exploitation, exclusion, suffering, and despair: in a word, &lt;strong&gt;the stultification and denial of optimal human self-realization and thriving human communities.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this definition, it is clear that public health is all about giving people opportunities to live fulfilling lives. In fact, it seems that the goal is to maximize individual freedoms, within the bounds of not denying other individuals their freedoms. Later in this document, there is also an explicit discussion of responsibilities towards future generations and other organisms in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognize that these statements may all seem abstract. However, I think that before moving to more specific examples, we need to identify foundational points of agreement, such as the preciousness of self-realization. Then, we can build upon those foundations and deal with higher-level disagreements (e.g. differences in perspective about how we best allow people to self-realize) as they come. In the midst of extreme political polarization and ever-increasing complexity of societal problems, I believe that this kind of principled negotiation is necessary to develop a modern society that is just and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you too are someone who is interested in helping address large and complex issues in our society, I encourage you to articulate: what are your principles?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advice for the COMAP MCM/ICM</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/mcm-advice/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/mcm-advice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2017, 2018, and 2019, a team of two friends and I participated in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.comap.com/contests/mcm-icm&#34;&gt;Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP) International Mathematical / Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM)&lt;/a&gt;. The basic idea of the contest is that over 99 hours, a team of three undergrads is tasked with choosing one of six open-ended questions, building some kind of mathematical model, and writing a paper synthesizing their findings along with external research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the three years, my team&amp;rsquo;s projects spanned topics from happiness economics to the political impacts of climate change to the spread of the opioid epidemic. After being named one of the 36 winners (out of more than 25,000 teams worldwide) in 2019, I feel qualified to give out some advice for this contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t dive too much into the logistics, but preparing for the contest does make things run more smoothly. Pick out a place to work with your team where you won&amp;rsquo;t be distracted, where you have easy access to food and bathrooms, etc. Decide ahead of time what platforms you&amp;rsquo;re going to use to collaborate with your team (e.g. Overleaf, Google Docs, etc.). Plan ahead with school work / get excused from attending lecture so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about other responsibilities during the contest. Start the weekend well-rested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of tips that are more specific to how my team and I approached this contest. Clearly ours is not the only way to go, but if you&amp;rsquo;re on this site, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that you and I have some things in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a problem for which at least someone on your team has a personal and/or educational affinity. Starting from scratch (no background knowledge) makes it a lot harder to be creative and write a compelling paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having an interdisciplinary team dramatically increases the odds that at least one of your team members will have an affinity for at least one of the topics, and facilitates division of labor throughout the contest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground your project with lots of external information. Throughout your paper, reference theory (from both the social and natural sciences, depending on the problem) to motivate your modeling choices and compare your results with real statistics. Just remember to include a reference for EVERYTHING.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t try to learn much (if any) new math or computational techniques. You can go far with simple tools, and struggling to understand new concepts is time-intensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridging concepts across fields (especially ones with which one or more of your team members is already familiar) is a nice way of coming up with a novel solution that&amp;rsquo;s not too technically complex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocate plenty of time for writing and editing. A well-written paper (including the summary sheet) is crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun with it! Your paper doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be dry like many scientific journals &amp;ndash; in fact, the more creative you are, the more your paper will stick out to judges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persevere :) The more years you attempt this contest, the more strategies you&amp;rsquo;ll have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Effective Altruism (EA) / 80,000 Hours philosophy has guided many of my thoughts and actions over the past 4+ years. In this post, my goal is to articulate some of the most important and generalizable aspects of my EA journey so far. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet encountered the EA / 80,000 Hours movement, I recommend checking out Part 1!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overall-reflections&#34;&gt;Overall Reflections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internalizing many of the EA / 80,000 Hours ideas guided me into the field of environmental public health / biostatistics, no question. This semester, I’ve really enjoyed seeing the close alignment between these fields / movements in my introductory public health classes. Of course, there are countless other fields in which one can pursue having a positive impact along the lines of the EA literature. I can simply confirm that I am glad to have made decisions in accordance with this paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, critically examining one&amp;rsquo;s overall impact is not for the faint of heart. Some of the most distressing loops I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten stuck in over the years include questioning whether certain career / life opportunities are worth their associated environmental costs (such as plane flights) and financial costs (i.e. would it be better to donate money now to a cause than to invest in my personal career capital, which may help that or another cause in the long term?), balancing avoidance of the &amp;ldquo;white savior complex&amp;rdquo; with the potential for bringing in funding and technical expertise to under-resourced areas, and deciding how much to focus on science vs. public policy more directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;balancing-different-kinds-of-good&#34;&gt;Balancing Different Kinds of Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crux of the matter is that nothing we can do is 100% good by all definitions. Even determining if our actions have net positive impact is challenging / impossible. Was my flight to Nepal to volunteer with Engineers Without Borders net positive? In addition to the work that we did and the personal connections we made, all of the learning I did over that summer has helped me to build a more resilient mental framework about global inequities and to more realistically compare pathways for reducing global poverty. But will my having that knowledge end up being more helpful to others than if I’d simply donated the money for my plane ticket to one of the most cost-effective charitable organizations? Wouldn’t my environmental footprint be so much smaller if, instead of going to graduate school and pursuing a professional career, I went and lived off the grid in a tiny cabin in the woods? But then I would be reducing my opportunities to interact with and help others&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The what-ifs are endless, and it’s easy to feel overwhelmed if you let yourself dive too deep too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt; of individual giving, I have found &lt;a href=&#34;https://80000hours.org/articles/should-you-wait/&#34;&gt;this 80,000 Hours framework&lt;/a&gt; to be helpful. But that still doesn’t necessarily help us distinguish between / balance different types of “good”. Any model that we make to try and quantify and compare different kinds of impacts will have massive uncertainty and subjectivity because there are so many things that are difficult and/or rely on philosophical judgements to quantify. How do we value investment in public K-12 education versus Medicare? Funding to conserve biodiversity versus to fight oppression based on race, gender, or sexual identity? Etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much as I enjoy building mathematical models to describe the world, I don&amp;rsquo;t believe there is a way to maximize good across all the areas of life and society that I care about. Ultimately, on an individual level we have to choose what cause(s) to prioritize based on personal affinity and potential for impact. On a societal level, I believe that democracy is one of our best tools for deciding fair allocation of resources, though even the best national democracy is likely to fall short when considering international and/or intergenerational issues, given lack of representation by all affected parties. This, in turn, highlights the importance of public education, as it can help a population to be aware of the plights of other people across space and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fighting-the-white--privileged-savior-complex&#34;&gt;Fighting the White / Privileged Savior Complex&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues with the traditional EA paradigm is that it often assumes, or at least strongly implies, that people from privileged backgrounds can know and do what’s best for people in under-resourced situations. This can lead to ineffective or even harmful interventions, and also often perpetuates professional and socio-cultural power differentials between people in higher- and lower-income countries or communities within the same country. This problem is acknowledged (with links to more lengthy discussions) in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.effectivealtruism.org/faqs-criticism-objections#how-are-the-people-youre-trying-to-help-involved-in-the-decision-making&#34;&gt;Effective Altruism list of common objections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experiences associated with Engineers Without Borders confronted me with related issues countless times, and in large part convinced me to pursue a career in which I could help gain knowledge and allocate resources on more systemic levels. However, as I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed with multiple professors and other respected mentors, the counterweight is that directly focusing on research or interventions in low-income areas can bring in much-needed funding from higher-income institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue will not disappear any time soon; I anticipate needing to re-evaluate my ability to provide assistance without overstepping in all my future projects. In general, I believe that people with lived experience and/or intimate expertise must be included (and ideally should lead) when making decisions regarding ways to promote causes such as poverty reduction and racial justice. I dive deeper into this last conviction in my &amp;ldquo;Reflections on Privilege in Higher Education&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;careers-in-science-vs-policy&#34;&gt;Careers in Science vs. Policy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is clearly a spectrum in terms of how long it takes our work to positively impact the lives of others. In terms of fields that I’m interested in: many technical problems in science (especially those focused on methodology) are not immediately relevant for helping other people (and thus may feel less impactful) in the way that pushing forward legislation in a government agency or working for a non-governmental organization can be. This can be disheartening for those of us who are motivated by a more personal connection to the impacts of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I sense (and have been told by respected mentors) that this is changing somewhat: many scientists are beginning to engage directly with decision makers. This trend is boosted by the increasing availability of near-real-time data sets (e.g. Covid-19 counts) and recognition that sorting through such data sets often requires scientific expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, while I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to grapple with such questions for many years to come, I&amp;rsquo;m operating under the hope that by gaining a data science skill set grounded in public health applications, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to strike a balance in my career between indirect and direct work to help others. Though I’m still very much in the midst of figuring this stuff out, my best advice to stay motivated (for anyone following a similar path) is to seek out opportunities to help others along the way, through mentoring, collaborating on applied projects, volunteering, or some combination of the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parting-thoughts&#34;&gt;Parting Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I have found the EA / 80,000 Hours framework to be useful in framing my individual pursuit of positive societal impact, I do not believe that this is the only way to make decisions leading to a meaningful life. For instance, I highly value others&amp;rsquo; decision to pursue careers in music and writing fiction. Art could be considered a different kind of positive impact, but I tend to see it as divergent from the traditional EA / 80,000 Hours path.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Having an Impact, Part 1</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/impact-part1/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/impact-part1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My views and aspirations for both my professional and my personal life have been profoundly influenced by the Effective Altruism (EA) / 80,000 Hours movement. This post is meant to introduce those who haven’t encountered this movement to it. See &amp;ldquo;On Having an Impact, Part 2&amp;rdquo; for some of my reflections in light of this overarching philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;intro-to-effective-altruism-and-80000-hours&#34;&gt;Intro to Effective Altruism and 80,000 Hours&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Instead of citing everything in the paragraphs below, I’m including a list of links at the end of this post, which I encourage you to explore!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core question of EA / 80,000 Hours is: &lt;strong&gt;how can I most effectively help other people, given finite resources?&lt;/strong&gt; There are many ways in which we can help others: directly and indirectly, material and non-material goods and services, in the short-term and in the long-term, concentrated and dispersed across individuals…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;80,000 Hours often highlights the impact you can have in your career, but EA also encompasses the impact you can have by giving money to organizations which are doing good, engaging in advocacy, or helping others to increase their impact. Some of the key ideas promoted by EA / 80,000 Hours include focusing on cost-effectiveness, long-termism, personal fit, and collaboration with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt; means optimization of positive impact per dollar spent. To motivate this: it has been shown that the best global health interventions can be orders of magnitude more cost-effective than others. Thankfully, there are now organizations whose purpose is to determine the cost-effectiveness of different charitable organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EA / 80,000 Hours also argues that if we factor in the wellbeing of future generations, then &lt;strong&gt;long-term impacts&lt;/strong&gt; become more and more favorable. In terms of high-impact careers, this often translates into research- or policy-based vocations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;strong&gt;personal fit&lt;/strong&gt;, 80,000 hours makes a pretty strong case that we are most effective in jobs that align with our skills, interests, and personalities. However, they also discuss how individual abilities are most often built, not innate, so we can guide ourselves in certain directions over time if so we choose. While figuring out what kind(s) of work to pursue, they advocate “cheap” tests such as reaching out to others and trying things out on small scales. College is a great time to do this, as I discuss in &amp;ldquo;The Power of Showing Up and Reaching Out&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; is crucial for addressing large-scale and/or complex problems. Although collaboration has not always been promoted as a core idea by the EA/80,000 Hours community, I am highlighting it here because of my personal belief in its importance. Some conclusions that stuck out to me from &lt;a href=&#34;https://80000hours.org/articles/coordination/&#34;&gt;80,000 Hours’ article about collaboration&lt;/a&gt; are that to maximize coordination within a shared-aims community, we should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize upholding norms of kindness and honesty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in community capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be willing to specialize, explore, and even take opportunities with worse personal fit if they play to our comparative advantages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there are many directions to take the above list of ideas, some actions that immediately come to mind for the fields that I’m interested in are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote transparency in science and policy-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentor others and develop strong collaboration skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lean into unusual skill sets, as I discuss in &amp;ldquo;Pursuing STEM, Motivated by the Humanities&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one of the things I appreciate about the core philosophical framework of 80,000 Hours is their emphasis on &lt;strong&gt;moral uncertainty and moderation&lt;/strong&gt;. I believe it is important for all of us to remain intellectually humble and to avoid choosing extreme courses of action unless there is broad consensus on the existence of substantial evidence that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the costs. &lt;em&gt;Note: despite this acknowledgement, most of the EA / 80,000 Hours arguments tend to lean utilitarian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overarching goal of exploring these ideas is to develop a framework for thinking about our impact on others that allows us to move forward on an informed path, instead of being paralyzed or moving forward on an ineffective (or even harmful) path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;resources-to-explore&#34;&gt;Resources to Explore&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many well-written, in-depth but also accessible resources provided by EA / 80,000 Hours. Here are links to some of the core resources and other articles that have most resonated for me. These in turn link to many other articles, so if these topics interest you, you may find yourself going down a rabbit hole, as I have done many times!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that nearly all of the resources related to high-impact careers are intended for a college-educated audience with the ability to choose / change their career path. However, the resources related to effective donations are relevant for almost everyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pursuing STEM, Motivated by the Humanities</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/stem-humanities/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/stem-humanities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an alternate but closely related universe, I could easily have chosen a career in the humanities. I love learning about sociology and philosophy. I am most intellectually enthusiastic when pondering underlying societal phenomenon and the ways we might go about addressing societal issues which manifest human suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, several important factors guided my path into statistics and data science. Firstly, my parents brought my brother and me up to be very conscious of the vocational value of our educations, as well as to gravitate towards career paths which keep doors open and allow for maximal flexibility. Given the modern world&amp;rsquo;s number and variety of jobs in STEM, we were both nudged in that direction. Under the umbrella of practicality, I also grew up with the knowledge that PhDs in STEM are most often fully funded, while many/most other graduate degrees are not, and that it is most often easier to transition from a more technical / hard science field into a less technical / softer skills position than to transition the other way. Further, the fact that both of my parents studied science and math made going into STEM the obvious thing to do. Somewhere along the way, I also came to realize that being someone who wanted to and was able to effectively bridge ideas between STEM and humanities disciplines was relatively rare, making this a valuable niche to pursue. Finally, as I discuss at the end of &amp;ldquo;The Benefits of Attending Your State’s Public University for Undergrad&amp;rdquo;, there were a number of factors at CU that kept me in STEM once I was there, namely stronger peers and harder classes (on average) and more research opportunities &amp;ndash; many professors need students who can assist with quantitative tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I reflect on my experiences as a STEM student with a humanities heart. A recent conversation with an older student in my PhD program reminded me that I&amp;rsquo;m far from alone in this and that being candid about our experiences can help to assure and guide others as they make their way on similar trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-strength-of-interdisciplinarity&#34;&gt;The Strength of Interdisciplinarity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout undergrad, my choices of classes, projects, and extracurricular activities  were guided by my humanities interests. And it was at the intersection of my STEM and socially-oriented studies that my most interesting and meaningful experiences arose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many of my upper division classes, I had the opportunity to design a final project that built off of material from the class. Being able to select a social or environmental application that I was interested in made doing all of these projects more fun and useful. For instance: in my machine learning class, I worked on a model to classify cervical cancer cases (a huge public health problem in low- and middle-income countries). That same semester, I chose to write my final paper for my health and medical geography class on cervical cancer.  In my advanced remote sensing course, I analyzed air pollution trends (captured by satellite proxy) over six capital cities in South Asia. In my data assimilation class, I modeled annual flu seasons in Colorado. In my network dynamics course, I developed a model that used Census data to predict migration of people between major cities in the US. In my development geography class, I wrote a paper on the incorporation of data science into global public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combination of STEM and social interests also led me to opportunities outside of classes. For instance, my simultaneous enrollment in environmental sociology and introductory data science courses in my freshman year led me to my environmental health data science research internship of the next three years (see &amp;ldquo;The Power of Showing Up and Reaching Out&amp;rdquo;). Drawing on my interests and affinities for mathematical modeling, analyzing social and environmental issues, and writing helped my team do well in the international COMAP MCM/ICM (see &amp;ldquo;Advice for the COMAP MCM/ICM&amp;rdquo;). And my interest in using STEM to help reduce socioeconomic inequities led me to CU Engineers Without Borders (EWB). My involvement in EWB over the four years was one of the most educational and meaningful experiences of my time in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, being grounded by a sense of societal purpose helped me both internally and externally. Internally: feeling like I was doing meaningful work and/or tangibly preparing for a career of meaningful work helped motivate me when the going got tough. Externally: having a framework on which to base my personal narrative and goals made it much easier to apply for opportunities such as scholarships and graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that developing this framework, figuring out how to combine my interests, was straightforward. For a detailed account of the twists and turns of my experience, see my post &amp;ldquo;On Finding a Career Path&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;potent-challenges&#34;&gt;Potent Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous sections might have made this kind of path seem like a no-brainer. However, the most obvious downside of my path is that I have struggled a lot with some of my applied math courses. Countless times, material in the more theory-based courses has made me feel intimidated and inadequate. I know from conversations with other students in my undergrad and grad programs that impostor syndrome (feeling like you don&amp;rsquo;t belong) is quite common. However, I suspect that I might have felt / continue to feel less anxious about my intellectual abilities had I chosen a field for which my brain feels a more direct affinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, being in a STEM program can make it harder to develop soft skills, due to lack of time. Taking the minimum required humanities classes for a STEM degree may not provide you with your desired levels of skill in writing, oral presentation/discussion, or thinking critically about social issues. Thus, you have to consciously carve out time for learning and practicing in these areas if you want them in your interdisciplinary toolbox. Especially when you have many other commitments, carving out extra time may not be trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parting-thoughts&#34;&gt;Parting Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in a similar position on your education/career path, I recommend going out of your way to find opportunities to use your interdisciplinary skills. These experiences can help to validate your efforts and make bearable the parts you don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy as much. To manage the impostor syndrome, I&amp;rsquo;ve also found it helpful to remind myself that I&amp;rsquo;m not directly competing (in a broader career sense) with the people who are killing the math theory game. If you&amp;rsquo;re someone who can use STEM tools but who are also driven by and can draw on non-technical domain knowledge, you&amp;rsquo;re able to define your own playing field, or league. Lastly, I advise carving out time to develop strong communication skills (written and oral). Collaborating across disciplines, especially if you want your work to have broader impacts, requires effective communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

      <title>On Finding a Career Path</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/finding-career-path/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/finding-career-path/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Planning out your life is impossible. Circumstances change, people change. New information comes to your attention and you shift course. But at the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to have a sense of direction, a sense of purpose, to guide your thoughts and actions. Having an idea of where you want to end up can provide this sense of direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of navigating life in this way like hiking through the wilderness. Setting your sights on a distant mountain frees you from having to expend energy on wayfinding every second of every day. You can focus instead on where you&amp;rsquo;re putting your feet and on enjoying the more nearby scenery. As you&amp;rsquo;re making your way across the plains, a different mountain might come into view. Or, maybe, the coast of a large body of water. You might decide this new destination looks better than the first mountain, so you re-orient in that direction. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll visit the first mountain someday, maybe you won&amp;rsquo;t. And so it goes: at any point in time, you are hiking towards something, but that something can change as frequently as you want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing with this analogy: as you make your way in your intended direction, you will likely encounter other people (depending on how remote the trail is). If you are able to describe where you&amp;rsquo;re headed, these people may be able to give you advice, having previously explored similar places. This is another reason it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to have a sense of direction: you can make it easier for other people to help you. The more detail you provide, the more specific other people can be with their advice. And, if you&amp;rsquo;re visibly inspired about where you&amp;rsquo;re going, other people are often more inspired to help you get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, maybe somewhere along your path, you see a sign post indicating that there is a town a few miles away. If you have a sense of where you&amp;rsquo;re attempting to go in the near future, then you might choose to go stock up on appropriate supplies: if you&amp;rsquo;re headed up the mountain, you might get some gloves. If you&amp;rsquo;re headed to the coast, you might get some sunblock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally have found the advice &amp;ldquo;always be moving forward on a path, even if you&amp;rsquo;re often switching paths&amp;rdquo; to be very helpful so far in my education and life. I have also frequently used the strategies of asking others for advice along the way and stocking up on various forms of domain knowledge and technical skills if I can foresee a major use for them farther on my intended path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next two sections, I share the relatively abbreviated story of how I ended up with a major in applied math, minors in statistics, economics, and geography, and an upcoming five more years of school in environmental biostatistics. The first section is the more straightforward narrative that I might share in an interview or application. The second section is the more nuanced, more human, and likely more relatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alls-clear-in-hindsight-one-version-of-how-i-ended-up-on-my-current-path&#34;&gt;All&amp;rsquo;s clear in hindsight: one version of how I ended up on my current path&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early high school, the societal issue that I cared about the most was environmental sustainability. In my junior year of high school, I took an environmental systems class that illustrated the close relationship between environmental and economic issues. My family also talked fairly regularly about the issue of economic inequality in our society. When I started college, I decided to study applied math with an emphasis / minor in economics and potentially also one in environmental science. The applied math major appealed to me because it would give me some concrete problem-solving skills while also allowing me to explore other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my freshman year, getting involved with Engineers Without Borders and reading outside of classes helped me to see more connections between economic development, environmental issues, and equity, as well as to recognize that if I want to help large numbers of people in the US and abroad, my background and skill set are well-suited to working at a systemic level: influencing policy and directing resources to where they&amp;rsquo;re most needed on a large scale. (For more thoughts in this vein, see &amp;ldquo;On Having an Impact, Part 2&amp;rdquo;.) I also self-confirmed my affinity for data science through an introductory data science course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my sophomore year, I began working as a data science intern on the environmental health team in Earth Lab (see &amp;ldquo;The Power of Showing Up and Reaching Out&amp;rdquo; for the story of how I got involved in this research). Through being in Earth Lab, I learned that it is possible to harness large, publicly-available data sets to answer all kinds of environmental questions. This inspired me to take some classes in remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) in the department of geography. Finally, the specific research that I was doing on the environmental health team (helping to investigate statistical associations between air pollution from wildfires and human health outcomes) inspired me to learn more about public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of my junior year, I took a health and medical geography class taught by Colleen, my research mentor. This course confirmed in my mind that public health lies at the intersection of economics, the environment, and human well-being. I began talking with professors about pursuing a graduate degree in public health that utilized data science tools, and stumbled upon the field of biostatistics. In the spring of my junior year, I had the chance to take classes in general statistical modeling and spatial statistics. My enjoyment of both of these classes confirmed to me that biostatistics with an emphasis on environmental health (which often uses spatial statistics) would be a good fit for me in graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer between my junior and senior years, I spent a lot of time reading scientific papers about air pollution epidemiology and childhood asthma to complement our collaboration project with the Denver Department of Public Health &amp;amp; Environment (again, see &amp;ldquo;The Power of Showing Up and Reaching Out&amp;rdquo;). This helped me gain familiarity with some environmental health methods as well as with what is generally known about the health impacts of various environmental exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my senior year, having chosen the path that I wanted to take in graduate school, I spent some more time exploring. In addition to my technical applied math and statistics courses, I took a graduate-level development geography course to gain a more academic perspective on the history and current theory on international development work, a course on statistical collaboration which taught students how to communicate and work effectively with domain experts so as to provide statistical expertise on various projects, and a philosophy course. These were the most purely enjoyable classes I took all year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, all of my exploration has helped me to identify a discipline that combines many of my interests and will allow me to develop a sufficiently general toolbox of statistical skills that I will be able to continue working on a variety of projects over the course of my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twists-turns-and-opportunity-costs-another-version-of-my-story&#34;&gt;Twists, turns, and opportunity costs: another version of my story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section above might make it seem like I knew what I was doing at every step of the way. During most of my years at CU, however, I felt like I was leaping between career paths: economist, international development expert, GIS scientist, environmental epidemiologist, biostatistician. And there were many more divergent career paths that I considered but did not spend as much time exploring, in part because of my motivation to stay in STEM (see &amp;ldquo;Pursuing STEM, Motivated by the Humanities&amp;rdquo;). In terms of courses: at various points along the way, I envisioned getting minors in computer science, journalism, sociology, or philosophy. I also certainly experienced (and continue to experience) plenty of decision paralysis and impostor syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my story would not be complete without mentioning that in between my junior and senior years of high school, I had decided to pursue a career in classical music performance, and spent much of my senior year of high school preparing for and carrying out auditions for college programs in music. One of the reasons I originally chose to study applied math at CU was that it seemed like a relatively flexible double-major alongside a major in clarinet performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing about my journey in this way also obscures the opportunity costs of my decisions: there were many experiences, both professional and personal, that some peers had but I did not have in college. For instance: I have zero experience working in the private sector. Many of my friends have learned lots from doing internships at companies over the summer or during the academic year, and I did not explore this avenue. In the personal realm: I spent less time on social and outdoor activities than I might have otherwise enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overall-thoughts&#34;&gt;Overall thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of us, I believe that there are many ways to lead a fulfilling life. I suspect that I could just as easily have fallen onto a different career path and felt just as fulfilled had my opportunities and mentorship been different. That said, given the opportunities and mentorship that life does present us with, how can we go about choosing a path to follow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found an iterative process to work the best. Start out on one path (maybe one that will give you a general set of skills), then, if something comes along that looks interesting, check out that for a while to see how it feels. This might sound completely random, but if we simultaneously spend time figuring out what we really value in our lives and work, then I believe that the paths that appear and look appealing will tend to be at least somewhat complementary to the one we&amp;rsquo;re already on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to remember is that, especially in an era where many (if not most) people have more than one job during their career, switching gears and changing paths is not a bad thing. Each time you re-orient, you will likely retain what you gained in your previous orientation. And in the end, having a more unusual path can often provide you with a less common and more compelling skillset.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Honest Conversation About Box-Checking</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/box-checking/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/box-checking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Box-checking&amp;rdquo; has a pretty negative connotation. It implies that your actions are inauthentic: the only reason you are doing something is to put it on your resume / achieve some glamorous end goal, not because you actually want to do it. It is often associated with helicopter parents and overachieving students trying to get into prestigious colleges. It is perceived as soulless running of the rat race. In this post, I attempt to flesh out a more nuanced perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have observed that feeling the need to fill out one&amp;rsquo;s resume and appear objectively impressive can be incredibly stressful and potentially damaging for individuals&amp;rsquo; mental health. In high school, many of my peers were stressed all the time about whether they were doing enough to be accepted into their dream colleges. I feel fortunate to have avoided this in my late teenage years because I planned to attend my home state university. I truly believe that I was doing the things I did in high school (focusing mostly on music and sports) because I enjoyed them, not because I felt forced to do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After starting college, however, the lines between authentic engagement and box-checking became more blurred for me. Did I join Engineers Without Borders purely because I wanted to help other people and learn about the world or because I wanted this cool international volunteering experience in my back pocket? Did I start doing my research internship because I really wanted to spend more hours of the day learning how to code in R or because I knew that it would open doors to future opportunities? Did I spend more time than I needed to setting up a socially-positive collaborative research project simply because I thought that it was important work to do or because I was already planning to apply for grad school in public health and knew that such a project would help strengthen my application? The honest answer to all of these questions is &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;. At times, I have felt uncomfortable with this duality: am I doing this because I care about it or because it will look good on my resume?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I have come to the conclusion that this is a false duality. The overarching question to be asking is whether or not my actions are aligned with my values. If my career goals are aligned with my values, then doing things that help to advance my career (including working harder than I might otherwise enjoy) are often consistent, especially if I find the things I&amp;rsquo;m doing along the way to be meaningful in their own right. However, how can I determine the makeup of my intentions? How can I recognize whether I am motivated more by the prestige of an accomplishment or by the opportunities to help other people that will open up if I have that accomplishment? Does this balance of intentions (which is likely dynamic) even matter if the outcomes are positive for society? Thoughts in this vein are explored more in &amp;ldquo;On Having an Impact, Part 2&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back: the truth is, to have any semblance of control over your life, I believe you have to be at least somewhat strategic. One of my favorite professors likes to say that being successful in college (and in life) amounts to making a large number of small-scale good decisions. I add that while many small-scale decisions may be good on their own, one needs a sense of direction or purpose in order for the small decisions to amount to something good on the large scale. In other words, good decision-making requires context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we would all agree that &lt;em&gt;intentionality&lt;/em&gt; is a good thing. Identifying what you value, developing a vision of what you want your life to look like, and taking action to bring your vision about is necessary to avoid floating and letting circumstance and other people&amp;rsquo;s choices dictate what happens to you. Streamlining your efforts towards your goals is often helpful. (See &amp;ldquo;On Finding a Career Path&amp;rdquo;.) But there is also a limit beyond which thinking about the future and attempting to optimize your actions in the name of your goals becomes unhealthy and unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late in my junior year of college, I unintentionally crossed this boundary. I have always been someone who is very aware of the future, but I think what finally tipped me over the edge was that I had spent much of the year up to that point applying for prestigious national scholarships: the Goldwater, the Astronaut, and the Truman scholarships. I had spent so much time writing and editing essays and my CV that I began to lose track of who I was beyond these measures of academic success. Applying for prestigious opportunities became so ingrained in my routine that I was halfway into a preliminary application for the Rhodes Scholarship (a fellowship in the UK) before I realized that I actually wanted to stay in the US for grad school. That summer, after learning that I had been named a Goldwater scholar, an Astronaut scholar, and a winner of the MCM (an international mathematical modeling competition), I felt more anxious and depressed than I ever had before in my life. I convinced myself that I was stressed about big problems in the world, such as climate change, economic inequity, and politics. This rationalization was partially true: I am deeply concerned about these issues and I plan to help work on addressing them for the rest of my life. However, in retrospect, the primary reason for my unhappiness was that I was simultaneously revved and burnt out. I had eyes only for the next sign post, the next box to check to keep optimizing my resume. And I was miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, my parents helped me to recognize my obsession and to work on maintaining a healthier mindset and stress level. I now know that managing my tendency to get caught up in the CV game (or any other life &amp;ldquo;competition&amp;rdquo;) will be an ongoing personal challenge. And I know that I am not alone. In today&amp;rsquo;s world, we are constantly presented with snapshots of other people&amp;rsquo;s successes. I call this the social media effect. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s on Facebook or Instagram or LinkedIn, we are constantly shown what other people are most proud of and tend to fixate on the things others have that we do not. People in past generations have certainly experienced this as well, but the internet amplifies it to the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to my story: despite the unpleasantness of my peak resume obsession, all the time that I had spent reflecting, figuring out what I wanted to work on in the future, and practicing articulating these ideas within the confines of strict word limits was a boon when it came time to apply for grad school. It certainly made my senior year of college a lot less stressful. However, looking back, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether I&amp;rsquo;d advise a younger me to follow in my footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does this jumble of thoughts leave us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions of what to work on and how hard to work are difficult enough without simultaneously questioning our intentions. However, I have come to believe that &lt;em&gt;pausing&lt;/em&gt; and asking ourselves the following every so often can help us to stay on more healthy, grounded paths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am I feeling fulfilled by the work I am doing?&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes, fulfillment is synonymous with enjoyment. Other times, I might believe the work I&amp;rsquo;m doing is meaningful but not necessarily love completing the day-to-day tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why am I doing this work?&lt;/strong&gt; How do I feel about the balance of inwards (e.g. professional development) versus outwards (e.g. helping others) effort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the sacrifices I&amp;rsquo;m making to do this work consistent with my values?&lt;/strong&gt; Sacrifices might be intellectual, monetary, or related to work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no one else can give us these answers. This conclusion may be unsatisfying, but it is up to each of us to decide what we care about and whether our actions (including how hard we&amp;rsquo;re working and how long we have to wait for gratification) are in alignment with what we care about. Honestly answering these questions and willingly making changes in our behavior if and when we identify inconsistencies is a challenging and often cyclic endeavor, but ultimately is necessary if we wish to live authentic and meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflections on Privilege in Higher Education</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/privilege-higher-ed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/privilege-higher-ed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2020 has been a year of reflection for many people. In particular, I am optimistic that renewed focus on systemic racism and economic inequities will fuel real changes in how many individuals and organizations think about and act on promoting inclusivity and fairness. However, while reflecting on my undergraduate experience I have come to the conclusion that many of the advantages I had during college were somewhat subtle and/or difficult to address through many common techniques of diversity-promotion. By articulating these advantages and brainstorming some partial solutions, I hope that I and others can be more conscious of these exclusive processes and more in a position to help implement inclusive ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ways-that-my-privilege-has-helped-me&#34;&gt;Ways that my privilege has helped me&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious benefit of economic privilege is &lt;strong&gt;not having to worry about money&lt;/strong&gt; during college. Having to get a job to cover living expenses and/or tuition would have made everything (from courses to research to volunteering to attending extra seminars) so much more difficult, and doing all three at once impossible. Even with complete financial aid independent of work-study, however, the knowledge that your financial coverage depends on your grades is much more stressful than if the only thing you have to lose if you fail a test is your ego or your parents&amp;rsquo; approval. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: having high expectations from your ego and/or your family is stressful enough, but this is still fundamentally different. In general, having a financial safety net makes risk-taking (including academic and professional exploration) more possible and internally palatable. I will never truly know what it feels like to be worried about having enough money for next month&amp;rsquo;s rent, because I would always know in the back of my mind that I could ask my family for help. I have come to believe that this psychological difference can be very potent in determining individuals&amp;rsquo; ability to find and pursue opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major factor in higher education is &lt;strong&gt;knowledge about academic opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;, and so much of this knowledge comes from our parents and friends. Did your parents know that if you score at a certain level on the SAT, then you can automatically get some scholarship money every year from your state university? This was the case at CU. Did you know that PhD programs in STEM are most often fully funded, in contrast to most masters degrees from any field and PhDs from the humanities, as well as professional degrees such as law, business, or medicine, for which you have to pay? Did anyone tell you that going in to a professor&amp;rsquo;s office hours to talk with them about their research topics (which you can Google beforehand) is a great way to gain access to mentorship and research positions? If no one told you or your parents this kind of information, how are you supposed to navigate the world of higher education as successfully as those who are in the know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;rsquo;re not worried about finances in college, having the time and resources to pursue extracurriculars in high school (or earlier) can often provide a leg up in gaining &lt;strong&gt;self-confidence and various skills before entering college&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance: I know that I have benefitted from physical health habits from my high school sports team as well as public presentation skills developed during music performance. In addition to the obvious personal and professional benefits, extracurricular hobbies can help connect you with other privileged people who have had similar experiences. When it came to forming study groups with peers or getting to know professors and grad students, I often found myself talking about outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain biking, or skiing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent experience I had highlighted this subtle force at play. I had decided to attend an applied statistics seminar, curious to learn about some statistics applications in fields other than public health. I joined the Zoom call a few minutes early and listened to some of the professors chatting about hobbies they picked up during the pandemic quarantine. At one point, a professor said he and his wife were thinking about getting into cross-country skiing and asked if anyone knew much about the sport. There was a long pause on the call, then he asked again, sounding surprised that no one had spoken up. Mustering my courage, I turned on my camera and said that I was experienced with cross-country skiing. For context, I was on the Boulder Nordic Junior Racing Team for ten years. The professor enthusiastically messaged me in the Zoom chat, asking if I would be willing to talk with him sometime about what equipment to purchase. I agreed and then Googled him. It turned out he is an incredibly accomplished academic and is currently the director of a prestigious research institute at Harvard. The next day, we had a Zoom conversation not only about cross-country skiing but also some about our research interests. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether our paths will ever cross again, but this experience stood out to me as a classic example both of &amp;ldquo;The Power of Showing Up and Reaching Out&amp;rdquo; to people and of the networking advantages from shared hobbies as a result of financial privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;strong&gt;social products of privilege&lt;/strong&gt; include communication style and existing connections. The ways we speak and write, the way we formulate ideas, and the way we present ourselves are all strongly influenced by our social backgrounds &amp;ndash; who we have spent and currently spend time around. Subtle cues may make a student feel more or less comfortable approaching a professor or grad student or student organization. And of course, existing connections through your family or community not only can help you find internships but also can help provide you with context to guide you. For instance: the more adults or older students you know who have attended college or been in a white collar job, the more people you have to ask for advice. Even just listening to stories can help you feel more comfortable choosing certain paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by no means an exhaustive list, but I think these are the main factors that shaped my college experience and were heavily influenced by my privileged economic status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-ideas-for-remedying-these-inequities&#34;&gt;Some ideas for remedying these inequities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following ideas and opinions are not novel, but they are ones that I think the American education system needs to work on to level the playing fields in higher education as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public high schools need to have more rigorous programs for students and parents to learn about higher education options and associated financial choices&lt;/em&gt; (ideally aimed at families with lower levels of parent education). We the taxpayers need to vote in support of financing public education to make this (among other things) feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universities should strive to provide financial aid (to help with both tuition and living expenses) independently of student loans or work-study whenever possible&lt;/em&gt;, so that students have the same amount of time and energy as their more privileged peers to pursue extracurriculars and build wealth after graduation. Of course this is more expensive, but it should still be a prominent goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colleges should have programs / communities with the explicit mission of guiding and supporting students from less privileged backgrounds&lt;/em&gt;. Building social support systems and making academic and professional guidance more accessible is key. In particular, I think it is important to tell students about the availability of extracurricular and career opportunities, including the value of and possibilities for undergraduate research and internships. The CU College of Engineering BOLD Center appeared to me to model this type of action, with a combination of professional and personal support to help students figure out what they wanted to do with their lives and how to successfully pursue those paths. However, based on my observations at CU, I still think that more needs to be done to ensure that students from less privileged backgrounds have all the same information and opportunities. I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how to do this, except to set aside more university funds for these kinds of enterprises, so that credible people with ideas can take control and make appropriate changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unpaid internships should be strongly discouraged in university, nonprofit, and corporate settings&lt;/em&gt;. Otherwise, students who need to make money may miss out on the chance to gain real work experience, which in turn opens the door to future professional opportunities. However, this issue is not black and white because students will often start doing research in an unpaid position and then transition into a paid position, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want labs, organizations, or companies to stop offering as many internships because they have to pay undergraduate interns. The good news is that many universities offer programs to help pay students to work for a nonprofit organization for a summer or more. However, again, knowing that a program like this exists is crucial. At CU, for instance, this program doesn&amp;rsquo;t have nearly enough advertising for the student body at large. In general, universities should also try to fund more undergraduate research to increase accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Individuals in leadership positions who are willing to mentor students should make this clear to all&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, professors could explicitly tell all of their students that their office hours are open for discussion about career paths in their field in addition to going through class material (even if they restricted this kind of discussion only to times when no one else had questions on the class material). Then, professors should try to make just as much effort to connect with students with whom they do not have common background as with those with whom they share hobbies, etc. Similarly, student leaders in many school clubs could also make greater efforts to welcome and support students who they (we) don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily identify with off the bat. Of course this is easier said than done, but it&amp;rsquo;s aspirational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public educational institutions (both at the university level and K-12) should prioritize hiring of diverse faculty members as well as those with demonstrated commitment to diversity promotion&lt;/em&gt;. The former may help students from underrepresented groups to more easily find mentors with whom they personally identify and can communicate more freely. This too might be easier said than done because, due to past inequities, there may be fewer qualified candidates from underrepresented groups. Thus, in the interim it may be acceptable to hire and support some faculty who are dedicated to diversity promotion, regardless of their backgrounds. In general, universities should more formally include mentoring of undergraduates in the list of activities that can help faculty to receive tenure and other promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2020.1756542&#34;&gt;This recent journal article&lt;/a&gt; provides more detailed thoughts on mentoring undergraduate research in statistics, specifically. &lt;em&gt;2023 update:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c05185&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about building and retaining Black talent in Chemistry is also insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is by no means an exhaustive list of partial solutions. It is intended to spark further brainstorming and discussion among those with current or future influence over these kinds of processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Benefits of Attending Your State’s Public University for Undergrad</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/public-university-undergrad/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/public-university-undergrad/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Boulder, Colorado. The University of Colorado (CU) sits right in the middle of town. To many of my high school peers and their families, attending CU was a fallback. It was seen as unadventurous and not at all prestigious. Despite the many good reasons I had for attending CU, I recognize that these perceptions weighed on me somewhat over the last four years. Now, two months into a PhD program at Harvard, my last subconscious traces of insecurity about my undergraduate education have finally faded. The semester is still ramping up, but I feel very well prepared for success in my classes and research projects. I write this with the hope that others in similar positions in high school will feel more confident than I did in choosing what&amp;rsquo;s right for them and not caring what anyone else thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, here are the four main reasons for strong students to consider attending their state universities for undergrad: lower cost, lower stress, more opportunities per capita, and connections in your home state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;cost of college&lt;/strong&gt; nowadays is insane. For almost any family, paying between $30,000 and $300,000 for a four-year degree per kid is going to be difficult, if not impossible. If you can get a sufficiently large fraction covered by financial aid or merit scholarships, great. If not, these amounts of money have extremely high opportunity costs. The way my parents described opportunity cost to my brother and me was by telling us how much they had saved for each of us and asking us whether we&amp;rsquo;d like to spend all the money on college-related expenses or save some of it and put that towards other things such as a graduate or professional degree, a down-payment on a place to live, or traveling. This perspective made the financial choice much more tangible, and motivated both my brother and me to go to college in-state. However, I think that many families do not discuss family resources and choice of higher education in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s a question of taking on debt to pay for a more expensive education, then the choice is even more stark. In addition to hearing about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/how-student-debt-became-a-1point6-trillion-crisis.html&#34;&gt;college debt crisis&lt;/a&gt; on the news, this fact was driven home for me the year before I started college when my dad helped me make a realistic model of the long-term economic outcomes of college choice in Excel. Between paying off debt (with interest) and losing the opportunity to invest savings early on in life, the total cost of college debt can be enormous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I imagine few families discuss is the &lt;strong&gt;large number of opportunities per strong student&lt;/strong&gt; at a large state university. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re interested in gaining leadership or research experience, there are often more open resources and faculty members to engage with than there would be at a school where everyone is constantly jockeying for spots in clubs, teams, and research labs. During my time at CU, I observed that highly motivated undergrads (who took initiative in reaching out to professors) were able to gain research experience on par with the graduate students. This may also be true at more prestigious universities, but I think it is much less common and more competitive because the professors already have plenty of highly-qualified grad students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly suspect that I personally would not have been able to maintain good grades, work continuously as a research assistant, and engage in volunteering activities at the level I did at CU had I attended a more elite university. In addition to having less opportunities, I believe that attending a more competitive school would have prevented engagement in this volume of commitments by raising my stress level and inducing burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even at CU, &lt;strong&gt;finding an optimal stress level&lt;/strong&gt; for myself was not easy.  What seems like a fine amount of activities at one point in the semester can very easily feel like too much at other times in the semester (around exams, when a club has a large paperwork deadline, etc.). Another major challenge for me has been building confidence in my technical skills and fighting &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/11/fraud&#34;&gt;impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Perceptions abound that math and computer science are difficult, that one must be &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; to do well in these fields. My personal experience over the last four years was that I have had to work very hard to do well in technical courses, but that with enough time, I can learn pretty much any material. This all might sound obvious, but truly internalizing a &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means&#34;&gt;growth mindset&lt;/a&gt; is often quite challenging. I imagine that being in a more competitive academic environment would have made it even harder for me to feel competent, possibly to the point that I would have decided to pursue a less technical degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A side note about academic competition:&lt;/em&gt; a motto of the CU Engineering Honors Program, a residential-academic program that was one of the defining elements of my undergraduate experience, was &amp;ldquo;being ambitious without being competitive&amp;rdquo;. While this is of course easier to say than to do, I believe that it is possible to be a content and successful student with this mindset, especially if academic programs incentivize collaboration. For instance: in my current graduate program, our class grades are not curved, and it is encouraged that we study together and help each other to pass the qualifying exams (comprehensive exams we take after the first year, as a gateway to becoming full-fledged PhD candidates). Being encouraged and supported in maintaining a collaborative mindset in undergrad prepared me well for this environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have found it meaningful to be able to pursue &lt;strong&gt;connections in my home state&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether volunteering for or collaborating with organizations that are based locally or networking with local professionals inside and outside of academia, I have found this personally fulfilling and professionally promising. My perspective is of course biased because I love Colorado and would someday like the choice to be able to move back and be close to my family and the mountains, but I suspect that many young people might be coming to similar conclusions about the appeal of having geographical roots. Especially when considering the financial and environmental costs of travel, choosing to live in a place that fulfills your needs and wants is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One perception I have not yet addressed is that attending one&amp;rsquo;s state school is unadventurous. However, I found that to be a non-issue in my time at CU, despite having grown up less than 3 miles from the university campus. In fact, I suspect that by getting involved with Engineers Without Borders, I learned more about the world than many of my high school peers who went to university in other states. In general, making an effort to get to know lots of different people, taking classes and intellectually engaging in areas which challenged many of my views, and trying out new activities (such as swing and salsa dancing and rock climbing) made my time at college feel plenty adventurous. This might sound cliché, but I tend to think that wherever you end up, there are ways to make life novel if you have an open mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course, all of us tend to rationalize the choices we have made&lt;/em&gt;. Despite having no regrets about my choices of undergraduate education, I recognize that attending CU drove me (and many of my peers) into STEM more strongly than we might have been driven at more elite colleges. One reason for this is that STEM classes at state schools are often more comparable with those at more prestigious schools than are humanities classes, which causes and is in turn caused by students with stronger academic backgrounds gravitating into STEM degree programs. Another reason for this is that in certain fields such as consulting and law, prestige of your undergraduate institution matters, whereas in STEM (and some other fields), the institution at which you got your terminal degree tends to be the only one that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Power of Showing Up and Reaching Out</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/showing-up-reaching-out/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/showing-up-reaching-out/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When people ask me for advice about college, this is the number one thing I tell them: you never know what will happen if you show up to an event and/or reach out to someone. I feel very grateful that my parents instilled this in me before I went off to college, because it led to every single one of the best opportunities I had during undergrad. By sharing the following stories, it is my intention that others might be inspired to muster the energy and overcome the initial awkwardness of showing up and reaching out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;story-1-how-i-got-involved-in-undergraduate-research&#34;&gt;Story #1: How I Got Involved in Undergraduate Research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring of my freshman year of college, two of my courses were an introductory data science course and an environmental sociology course. In the environmental sociology course, there was a brief lecture on the health impacts of air pollution, which I found fascinating. In the data science course, our final project was to analyze a data set of our choice. I thought it would be cool to combine these interests, and after reading a bit online, I came up with the idea of analyzing whether proximity to highways was associated with asthma rates. I spent a while looking for data online and found some aggregated data sets, but thought there were probably much better publicly-available options that I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started Googling professors at CU who might know where to get data related to air pollution from roadways. I ended up emailing a professor in environmental engineering who does a lot of work on air pollution. She forwarded me to a professor in geography with expertise in the health impacts of air pollution. This professor, Colleen Reid, invited me to meet with her to discuss my project. Our discussion ended up covering a lot more than just this project, as I learned about her research and other opportunities at CU for applying quantitative methods to study social issues. After our meeting, I sent her an email thanking her for our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four months later, Colleen emailed me a flyer for an undergraduate data science internship (advised by her) helping to study the health impacts of air pollution from wildfires. It turned out that only two undergraduates applied: me and a student with no background in statistics or data science. Colleen became my research mentor, and I spent the next three years working with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;story-2-how-i-started-a-collaboration-with-the-denver-department-of-public-health--environment&#34;&gt;Story #2: How I Started A Collaboration with the Denver Department of Public Health &amp;amp; Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year and a half after I started working with Colleen, she mentioned to me and her post-doc Melissa that there was going to be a day-long symposium on climate change and health in Denver the following month. We decided to go, even though it meant that I would be skipping a day of school. During one of the presentations, someone mentioned an initiative deploying low-cost air quality sensors at schools in Denver. I was curious to learn more about that initiative, so I made myself a note and started Googling when I got home. I was pretty easily able to find a description on the Denver Department of Public Health &amp;amp; Environment (DDPHE)&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the next week&amp;rsquo;s research group meeting, I mentioned the initiative to Colleen and wondered out loud whether analyzing data from such a program could potentially be a collaboration for our group. She said that she knew the head of the program, and asked if I would like to set up a call with them. Over the ensuing Skype call with the head of the DDPHE air quality program, it turned out that DDPHE had access to asthma medication usage records from Denver Public Schools (DPS) in addition to air pollution measurements from their low-cost sensor network, but didn&amp;rsquo;t yet have anyone analyzing the data. They were enthusiastic about us analyzing the data for them, especially when we proposed that I could apply for undergraduate research funding through the university so that they didn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay me. Thus began a collaboration through which I learned a lot about air quality sensors and statistical methods to make the low-cost sensor measurements more accurate, and Colleen and I were able to advise DDPHE and DPS on how best to correct their air pollution measurements and how to record/aggregate future data on asthma rescue medication usage to make it most useful for health studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;story-3-how-i-developed-a-leadership-role-in-cu-engineers-without-borders-ewb&#34;&gt;Story #3: How I Developed a Leadership Role in CU Engineers Without Borders (EWB)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every organization has unique ins and outs, but I am willing to bet that the majority of volunteer-based organizations conform to the following statement: the more time you spend in attendance at meetings and events and the more questions you ask, the faster you will become a member of the functional core (the people who know stuff and get things done). This was certainly true of my experience with EWB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my first semester of college, after being inspired to get involved with EWB, I showed up to a lot of meetings, including student-only ones on weeknights and meetings with a group of professional mentors every other Sunday at 8am in the CU Engineering Center lobby. Because I was in attendance, because I was attuned and asking questions and volunteering to do random tasks, I became one of the most involved first-year students and ended up being selected to join the summer travel team to Nepal. Upon my return from Nepal, I continued being present at both student-only and mentor meetings. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into all the details here, but my experiences with EWB (including getting to know people in that extensive community) were some of the most valuable of my whole college experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;caveat&#34;&gt;Caveat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not every interaction will yield a tangible result &amp;ndash; the idea is that over time, one becomes better positioned to benefit from circumstance: as they say, luck favors the well-prepared!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as convinced as I am of the power of showing up and reaching out, I recognize the bias of my perspective due to my background. For thoughts in this vein, see my &amp;ldquo;Reflections on Privilege in Higher Education&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
