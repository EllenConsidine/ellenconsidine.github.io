      <title>Teaching Fellow for Graduate-Level Biostatistics Courses</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/project/tf/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are descriptions of the three full-semester courses that I helped teach at HSPH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spring-2024-bst-226-applied-longitudinal-analysis&#34;&gt;Spring 2024: BST 226, Applied Longitudinal Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approx. number of students: 100
Course description: This course covers modern methods for the analysis of repeated measures, correlated outcomes and longitudinal data, including the unbalanced and incomplete data sets characteristic of biomedical research. Topics include an introduction to the analysis of correlated data, analysis of response profiles, fitting parametric curves, covariance pattern models, random effects and growth curve models, and generalized linear models for longitudinal data, including generalized estimating equations (GEE) and generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fall-2023-bst-210-applied-regression-analysis&#34;&gt;Fall 2023: BST 210, Applied Regression Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approx. number of students: 75
Course description: Topics include model interpretation, model building, and model assessment for linear regression with continuous outcomes, logistic regression with binary outcomes, and proportional hazards regression with survival time outcomes. Specific topics include regression diagnostics, confounding and effect modification, goodness of fit, data transformations, splines and additive models, ordinal, multinomial, and conditional logistic regression, generalized linear models, overdispersion, Poisson regression for rate outcomes, hazard functions, and missing data. The course provides students with the skills necessary to perform regression analyses and to critically interpret statistical issues related to regression applications in the public health literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fall-2021-bst-222-basics-of-statistical-inference&#34;&gt;Fall 2021: BST 222, Basics of Statistical Inference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approx. number of students: 75
Course description: This course provides a basic yet thorough introduction to the probability theory and mathematical statistics that underlie many of the commonly used techniques in public health research. Topics covered include probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson), means, variances and expected values, finite sampling distributions, parameter estimation (method of moments, maximum likelihood), confidence intervals, hypothesis testing (likelihood ratio, Wald and score tests). All theoretical material are motivated with problems from epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health and other public health areas. This course is aimed towards second year doctoral students in fields other than Biostatistics. Background in algebra and calculus required.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Climate &amp; Health Event Series, Science Policy Group</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/project/scipol/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the roles I undertook as Vice-President of the Harvard graduate student science policy group was co-organizing a series of events at the intersection of climate &amp;amp; health. This brought together students and staff from across the Harvard School of Public Health, Medical School, Dental School, and Graduate School of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences. In particular, I spearheaded and moderated a panel and networking dinner focused on the translation of research into policy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hugoblox.com&#34;&gt;Hugo Blox Builder&lt;/a&gt; is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this page, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:&lt;/p&gt;


    
    &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2vj0WcvH5c?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;
      &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bilibili&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; bilibili id=&amp;quot;BV1WV4y1r7DF&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your &lt;code&gt;assets/media/&lt;/code&gt; media library or in your &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/&#34;&gt;page&amp;rsquo;s folder&lt;/a&gt;, and then embedding them with the &lt;em&gt;video&lt;/em&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; video src=&amp;quot;my_video.mp4&amp;quot; controls=&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;podcast&#34;&gt;Podcast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page&amp;rsquo;s folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the &lt;em&gt;audio&lt;/em&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; audio src=&amp;quot;ambient-piano.mp3&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out:&lt;/p&gt;








  








&lt;audio controls &gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/teaching/js/ambient-piano.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;test-students&#34;&gt;Test students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the &lt;code&gt;spoiler&lt;/code&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;spoiler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;👉 Click to view the solution&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;You found me!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;spoiler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary class=&#34;cursor-pointer&#34;&gt;👉 Click to view the solution&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;rounded-lg bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-800 p-2&#34;&gt;
    You found me 🎉
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;flex px-4 py-3 mb-6 rounded-md bg-primary-100 dark:bg-primary-900&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;pr-3 pt-1 text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-300&#34;&gt;
  &lt;svg height=&#34;24&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; stroke-width=&#34;1.5&#34; d=&#34;m11.25 11.25l.041-.02a.75.75 0 0 1 1.063.852l-.708 2.836a.75.75 0 0 0 1.063.853l.041-.021M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0a9 9 0 0 1 18 0m-9-3.75h.008v.008H12z&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;dark:text-neutral-300&#34;&gt;We wrap the LaTeX math in the Hugo Blox &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;strong&gt;math block&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34; data-lang=&#34;latex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sb&#34;&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\gamma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;_{n} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\frac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;^T &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; |}{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\|\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{x}_{n}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{x}_{n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}

&lt;p&gt;Hugo Blox Builder utilises Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. The code theme can be selected in the &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv(&amp;quot;data.csv&amp;quot;)
data.head()

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hugoblox.com&#34;&gt;Hugo Blox Builder&lt;/a&gt; is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this page, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:&lt;/p&gt;


    
    &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2vj0WcvH5c?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;
      &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bilibili&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; bilibili id=&amp;quot;BV1WV4y1r7DF&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your &lt;code&gt;assets/media/&lt;/code&gt; media library or in your &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/&#34;&gt;page&amp;rsquo;s folder&lt;/a&gt;, and then embedding them with the &lt;em&gt;video&lt;/em&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; video src=&amp;quot;my_video.mp4&amp;quot; controls=&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;podcast&#34;&gt;Podcast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page&amp;rsquo;s folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the &lt;em&gt;audio&lt;/em&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; audio src=&amp;quot;ambient-piano.mp3&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out:&lt;/p&gt;








  








&lt;audio controls &gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/teaching/python/ambient-piano.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;test-students&#34;&gt;Test students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the &lt;code&gt;spoiler&lt;/code&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;spoiler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;👉 Click to view the solution&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;You found me!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;spoiler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary class=&#34;cursor-pointer&#34;&gt;👉 Click to view the solution&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;rounded-lg bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-800 p-2&#34;&gt;
    You found me 🎉
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;flex px-4 py-3 mb-6 rounded-md bg-primary-100 dark:bg-primary-900&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;pr-3 pt-1 text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-300&#34;&gt;
  &lt;svg height=&#34;24&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; stroke-width=&#34;1.5&#34; d=&#34;m11.25 11.25l.041-.02a.75.75 0 0 1 1.063.852l-.708 2.836a.75.75 0 0 0 1.063.853l.041-.021M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0a9 9 0 0 1 18 0m-9-3.75h.008v.008H12z&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;dark:text-neutral-300&#34;&gt;We wrap the LaTeX math in the Hugo Blox &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;strong&gt;math block&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zooming Out -- On Sustainability, Social Justice, and Data</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/zooming-out/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The threat of climate change has been a driving motivation for both my professional and personal choices for many years. In practice, this has manifested as getting into the weeds with various academic subjects (i.e. air quality, statistics, public health, computer science) as well as recurrent introspection on many aspects of lifestyle. This spring, I was reminded of the importance of picking my head up and seeking out new perspectives &amp;ndash; despite the countless hours I&amp;rsquo;ve spent educating myself on environmental and social/economic justice topics, there is always more to learn and consider. In this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll share some broad reflections from several recent experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the ideas here were inspired by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading the book &lt;em&gt;Regenesis: Feeding the World Without Devouring the Planet&lt;/em&gt; (2022), by George Monbiot, and discussing in the Harvard graduate student Science Policy Group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serving as a Review Editor for the US&amp;rsquo; Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5), facilitating the incorporation of comments from public and peer review on the Western Wildfires Focus Box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attending the annual Health Effects Institute (HEI) Conference, specifically the sessions entitled &amp;ldquo;Exploring the Link Between Air Pollution and Health in High Pollution Environments&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Addressing Air Pollution and Climate Change with Shared Solutions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitating or listening in on various climate and/or air quality-related webinars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appreciating-the-complexity&#34;&gt;Appreciating the complexity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt;, in particular, was a powerful reminder of how multifaceted our global environmental + social justice challenges are. While at this point in my academic career, I rarely encounter truly novel information about air pollution or its impacts on public health, I was struck by how many fundamental things I did not know about our global food system &amp;ndash; on topics ranging from soil, plants, water, and their interactions with each other and with the atmosphere, to the many ways in which antibiotics, toxic metals, and microplastics are introduced to various stages of our food production, to the countless perverse financial incentives affecting farmers worldwide, to the degree of corporate monopoly / oligopoly not only in agrochemicals but also in the overall supply / trade of food. The list goes on, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the previous paragraph mostly being about problems, my favorite thing about &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt; was its balance: between problems and solutions, between narrative and traditional nonfiction, between breadth and depth, between science and philosophy. One of the most compelling (and generalizable) sections was a discussion of modern complex systems. Monbiot (the author) illustrates how there is a tradeoff between pursuing efficiency and maintaining resilience: basically, while standardization, just-in-time delivery, and strong interconnectedness between nodes (companies, regions, etc.) all make sense for each individual actor at the time of implementation, they also facilitate cascading failure when something goes wrong at any place in the system. Think global supply chain issues during Covid, the financial crisis of 2008, etc. This comparison is even more apt given the increasing coupling of the financial sector with the global food system. While the concepts of diversification and redundancy are not at all new, I found that Regenesis effectively shone a spotlight on how our current food system is particularly vulnerable to cascading failure (with deadly consequences for people in low-income countries or circumstances), especially in the context of climate change. The main takeaway, echoed in other recent seminars / experiences, is that while individual action is important, what is really needed to ward off system-level failure are system-level safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reasons-for-optimism&#34;&gt;Reasons for optimism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s critiques which felt particularly relevant to me (as a current grad student) was directed at modern academia: &amp;ldquo;A tremendous body of knowledge accumulates, but the walls between disciplines are high. In science, modularity is dangerous.&amp;rdquo; This year, participating in the preparation of the US NCA5 gave me a rare view of what fully bringing together and bridging scientific disciplines can look like. The National Climate Assessment is a large report, produced approximately every five years, summarizing the current and future impacts of climate change on the US. It is written by more than 300 experts, spanning disciplines ranging from forest ecology to urban planning. For the NCA5, a new element is the inclusion of &amp;ldquo;focus boxes&amp;rdquo;, or short chapters on topics that touch many other disciplines: compound events (disasters), Covid-19, risks to supply chains, blue carbon, and western wildfires. Other developments of the NCA5 (in contrast to previous assessments) were an increased focus on adaptation in addition to mitigation and both acknowledgement and discussion of environmental justice in every chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, sitting in a conference hall filled with the authors of the NCA5, listening to presentations (both scientific and activist * ) at the HEI conference as well as other climate change-related seminars, and reading &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt; were all positive reminders of how many smart, caring people are dedicating their lives to figuring out how to solve our pressing environmental / societal challenges. This is not to say that it feels in any way inevitable that everything will turn out alright &amp;ndash; there is a tremendous amount of work yet to be done, much of it in translating the science into regulatory, industrial, and social reform. But I feel more hopeful than I have in a while. And I imagine that by reading this, you might too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an example of actions being taken to fight environmental injustice, one of the most memorable presentations at the HEI conference was by GreenRoots, a community-based organization started in Chelsea, MA. Despite its close proximity to Boston, Chelsea (which is majority-racial minority) has much higher levels of pollution, mostly due to the high density of industrial facilities sited in and near the community. Check out a list of GreenRoots&amp;rsquo; recent successes here. But don&amp;rsquo;t forget to come back to this blog &amp;ndash; the most important section is below!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt;, I looked up some critiques of the book, to see what aspects might be reasonably contested. I&amp;rsquo;ve included the links to the most credible at the end of this blog. The following recommendations made by Monbiot appear to be somewhat universal among environmentalists (who care about human welfare) with regards to the global food system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dramatically shift our diets to rely less on animal products and highly-processed sugars/carbohydrates (the latter more for public health reasons)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize our use of water and farm chemicals, relying on organic interventions where necessary to enhance fertility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research and develop a high-yield &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fao.org/agroecology/overview/en/&#34;&gt;agroecology&lt;/a&gt;, including deepening our understanding of different kinds of soil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break global corporations&amp;rsquo; grip on the food chain and diversify the global food system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monbiot then goes on to make the following recommendations, which are the target of some critique:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit the land we use to feed humanity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop farming animals entirely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the protein and fat from animals with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gfi.org/resource/precision-fermentation-and-cellular-agriculture/&#34;&gt;precision fermentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewild the land released from farming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Monbiot also puts a lot of emphasis on numeracy, shifting the discourse about food and its production to be less aesthetic and more practical, and wherever possible using scientific &amp;ldquo;understanding of complex systems to trigger cascading change&amp;rdquo;. While I was reading the book, Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s suggestions all made a lot of sense to me. But some of the critiques I later read helped me to zoom out even farther, identifying some of my own blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most salient critiques of Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s whole platform is that despite his calls for strong antitrust laws and restraint of intellectual property regarding precision fermentation, history and current movements by major corporations indicate that oligopoly control of this new technology has relatively high likelihood. Using his own logic about increasingly-standardized nodes in complex systems, critics argue that although precision fermentation is less vulnerable to climate change than crops and animals living outdoors, it is still exposed to the capriciousness of the financial sector. My personal take (acknowledging that this is not my field of expertise and I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about it for more than a couple of months) is that if precision fermentation is what it takes to save humanity&amp;rsquo;s existence on Earth in the short run, then we will have time to figure out everything else (e.g. economic inequality) in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I also acknowledge the broader critique of Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s platform: that it is very techno-centric. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocentrism&#34;&gt;Techno-centrism&lt;/a&gt;, or the belief that technology can address all environmental / ecological problems, has long been debated in the context of climate change. Historically, a lot of the buzz surrounded carbon capture as a possible solution to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. (The current scientific consensus is that while carbon capture can help us with the &amp;ldquo;last mile&amp;rdquo;, it is not cost-effective for counteracting the vast majority of emissions.) But this is only one example of holding technology up as a silver bullet to fix environmental degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unherd.com/2022/11/the-truth-about-eco-fascism/&#34;&gt;One of the critiques&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt; articulated an important point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The question you ask will frame the philosophy you develop. If your question is &amp;lsquo;how can we remove all this atmospheric carbon to avoid what these computer models say is coming?&amp;rsquo; then the answer can only lead you to a globalized technocracy. If, on the other hand, the question you ask is &amp;lsquo;how can we build lives which offer us meaning, in alliance with the rest of nature?&amp;rsquo; then you may be led in a very different direction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of this article, Paul Kingsnorth, also posited a broader critique of 21st century environmentalism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you have ever wondered why climate change has so utterly dominated the green debate to the exclusion of so many other problems which stem from industrial society — mass extinction, soil erosion, the collapse of human cultures, ocean pollution — then the answer, I think, is here. Climate change is a problem amenable to numerical questions and technocratic answers. It is, furthermore, a problem which, almost by definition, can only be solved by elites. If you can’t read or understand the &amp;lsquo;peer-reviewed science&amp;rsquo; then you are open to being intimidated into fearful silence by those who can, or claim they can. And those people — drawn, as all green &amp;rsquo;thought leaders&amp;rsquo; are, from the upper strata of society — will bring with them a worldview which treats the mass of humanity like so many cattle to be herded into the sustainable, zero-carbon pen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent my last 3 years in the Biostatistics PhD program at Harvard, the 4 years before that at CU Boulder surrounded by people in STEM, and my childhood in Boulder (one of the most highly-educated cities in America), I am a poster child for Kingsnorth&amp;rsquo;s critique. And while I think the whole &amp;ldquo;treats the mass of humanity like so many cattle to be herded into the sustainable, zero-carbon pen&amp;rdquo; is overly harsh, I see some truth in his point about climate change lending itself more easily to quantitative analysis than many other environmental and societal problems. ** Similarly, environmental (health) statistics research is dominated by questions related to the quality and temperature of the air, rather than other mediums like water or soil, in part because of our ability to use measurements from technologies such as stationary ground-level monitors and satellite imagery to make inferences about broader areas and population exposures, given atmospheric mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, Kingsnorth and several other critics don&amp;rsquo;t seem to care so much about the elevation of climate science and renewable energy research over marine biology or soil science so much as the elevation of formal scientific investigation and technology overshadowing other forms of knowing and interacting with the environment. Several articles expressed concern that although in Regenesis Monbiot describes the importance of personal connection with nature, his recommended solutions might further distance people&amp;rsquo;s feeling of being connected to and dependent on the Earth and non-human species, with negative consequences both for people&amp;rsquo;s pursuit of meaning and concern for the environment. Borrowing one of Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s examples, I personally don&amp;rsquo;t see how a &amp;ldquo;dinosaur nugget&amp;rdquo; whose inner protein is sourced from precision fermentation distances people any more from nature or life meaning than one with protein sourced from chicken born, raised, and slaughtered on a factory farm. But I fully agree with the overarching point that it is important to be guided by diverse, not necessarily quantitative perspectives &amp;ndash; including lower-income, rural, Indigenous, Global South &amp;ndash; in attempting to design a more just and sustainable future for us all. And of course, that it is critical to continue trying to make both quantitative data sets and the groups of people who analyze them more representative of the population at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harmony between these two visions was articulated nicely by someone at the HEI conference, who said that while it&amp;rsquo;s easier to identify hotspots at scale, fixing the hotspots has to happen locally. In other words, while scientists with access to large data sets can help identify things like distributions, trends, or clusters from above, and can make &lt;em&gt;recommendations&lt;/em&gt; for where (and even how) to allocate societal resources to where they are most needed, and technologists can design tools that can be widely used, the ultimate implementation of effective, lasting solutions requires local buy-in and often also local tailoring. One size does not fit all &amp;ndash; even in the case of precision fermentation. Local government, businesses, and community-based organizations have a vital (possibly the most significant) role to play in the pursuit of environmental sustainability and social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-closing&#34;&gt;In closing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed this blog or not, I highly encourage you to go read &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt;! As I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed here, not everyone agrees with Monbiot&amp;rsquo;s perspectives, but being exposed to them and all the research he references is prime fodder for individual reflection and conversations about food, people, nature, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overview of Data Science Tools for Climate &amp; Health</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/project/online_course_climate-health-data-science/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a pedagogy fellow during AY 2022-2023, I developed this short course for the new online master&amp;rsquo;s in public health program at HSPH.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is one of the most (if not the most) pressing challenges of our time. Meanwhile, data science is a rapidly expanding field; references to the power of “machine learning” are ubiquitous. But what does “machine learning” really mean in the context of public health and climate change? In what situations might a really nice map make advanced statistical analysis gratuitous? This module will help you build a mental framework for distinguishing different aspects of data science and gain intuition for when these tools have the most potential to help us study and fuel action at the intersection of climate and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-objectives&#34;&gt;Learning Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differentiate between major categories of statistical / data science tools: (a) data visualization / mapping, (b) traditional statistical modeling / parametric regression, and (c) machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify areas of climate &amp;amp; health research and/or policy work for which the different types of tools are best suited, possibly in combination or to complement one another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain familiarity with common critiques / drawbacks of these types of tools, specifically at the intersection of climate and health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Statistical Consulting and Learning-Centered Teaching</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/stat-collab-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/stat-collab-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This academic year, I am a pedagogy fellow (PF) at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH). Instead of being a TF/TA for the Biostatistics Department (which typically involves grading, teaching labs and holding office hours for students), I work on developing curriculum and encouraging evidence-based teaching practices, both within my department and for the school overall. For HSPH-wide projects, I collaborate with PFs from other departments. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on insights inspired by my department-specific project as well as by a course on teaching that all the PFs took last semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context: in spring 2020, I really enjoyed taking a course at CU on statistical collaboration. (The Professor, Eric Vance, used the term collaboration as opposed to consulting to emphasize the importance of consistent, two-way communication between statisticians and domain experts.) When I heard that my current department was looking for a PF to redesign our PhD-level statistical consulting course, I applied immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond digging into statistical consulting, being a PF has been a great opportunity to think deeply about whether I want teaching to be a core part of my future career. The upshot on that front is that I&amp;rsquo;m still making up my mind. However, many of the ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve been synthesizing are broadly applicable on both individual and systemic levels, sufficiently so that they merit a post. The three main topics I will discuss are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evidence-based tools in education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key skills common to teaching and consulting / collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broad musings on modern education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evidence-based-tools-in-education&#34;&gt;Evidence-Based Tools in Education&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of Teaching 100 (the course the PFs took last semester), we read the book &lt;em&gt;Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning&lt;/em&gt;. We then proceeded to have eight weeks of discussions, led by instructor Tari Tan, about this material and more. During the class and in the months since, a few concepts in particular have stuck out to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one takeaway from &lt;em&gt;Make it Stick&lt;/em&gt; is that retrieval practice is critical for long-term learning. Retrieval practice is honestly testing your knowledge (as opposed to re-reading material), ideally waiting long enough between practices that you start to forget. Learning both concepts and skills this way is intentionally challenging, but has been shown over and over again to yield better educational outcomes than traditional studying. I was introduced to retrieval practice through studying music (my teacher would have me do practice performances where I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look at the sheet music), but looking back on my academic experience, I think retrieval practice is still under-utilized in most traditional classroom settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related concept is one that many people nowadays are familiar with: the power of cultivating a growth mindset. Despite the proliferation of this idea, STEM education (and math in particular) struggles with deeply-rooted notions that some people are destined to flourish and others are doomed to flail. My personal experience in math classes from middle school through grad school is that it can be really hard to prevent unsuccessful attempts from harming your perception of your overall competence (see &amp;ldquo;Potent Challenges&amp;rdquo; in a past blog post). Taking the time to think deeply about these issues in Teaching 100, I began to wonder whether centering tools like retrieval practice in classrooms (from an early age) and explicitly reinforcing the notion that all meaningful learning is difficult (and therefore must be undertaken iteratively) might boost many people&amp;rsquo;s development of growth mindsets. (Note: it&amp;rsquo;s possible that such a transition in standard educational practice is already somewhat under way, given what my mom said about her experience getting a teaching license several years ago. After all, it&amp;rsquo;s been two decades since I started kindergarten.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third aspect of Teaching 100 that I found especially compelling was active learning. The definition of &amp;lsquo;active learning&amp;rsquo; is very broad, but generally refers to educational activities with more student engagement than just listening to an instructor lecture for 60-90 minutes. While I previously had a somewhat lukewarm perception of the push for active learning (especially in higher education), in Teaching 100 we were presented with evidence that in addition to helping a class of students overall, active learning tends to disproportionately benefit students from marginalized racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. The more I reflect on this, the more it makes sense to me that increasing interaction between students and instructors, encouraging and guiding metacognition (self-reflection), and providing some additional course structure can help narrow educational achievement gaps between those who have received more academic / professional mentorship and those who haven&amp;rsquo;t. Deploying active learning strategies to address inequity in the classroom complements my discussion in &amp;ldquo;Reflections on Privilege in Higher Education&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-skills-common-to-teaching-and-consulting&#34;&gt;Key Skills Common to Teaching and Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my field of study, my thinking about consulting / collaboration is inevitably tied to statistics / data science. However, my sense is that many of these ideas apply much more generally. In fact, reflecting on my experience working to create curriculum for the statistical consulting course, I notice a lot of similarities between best practices taught in Statistical Collaboration and in Teaching 100. I share the most prominent here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy place to start is the importance of &lt;strong&gt;cultivating a welcoming environment&lt;/strong&gt; where people feel respected and are comfortable asking questions and voicing concerns. This is a core tenet both of learning-centered teaching and of building a productive working relationship with a domain expert / statistical consulting client. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into details here, but I believe in the power of both verbal and non-verbal cues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two related practices are an immediate focus on identifying each party&amp;rsquo;s goals / motivations and periodically &lt;strong&gt;ensuring that the work is in alignment with the goals&lt;/strong&gt;. As a statistician, this includes inquiring about what the intended product(s) and audience of a domain expert&amp;rsquo;s study will be, and highlighting any mismatches (as they arise) between the question of interest and available data / methods. As a teacher, this includes clearly articulating the course objectives and learning goals (e.g. in a syllabus) and helping students to align their learning experience with their educational / career goals, for instance through intermittent metacognition / reflection assignments. In both settings, &lt;strong&gt;writing down a clear plan&lt;/strong&gt; at the beginning of the partnership, explicitly laying out expectations and timelines for both productivity and communication between parties, is extremely helpful for getting everyone on the same page and making progress towards both parties&amp;rsquo; goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to clarifying overall goals, a communication strategy that resonates a lot with me for both settings is &lt;strong&gt;leading with intent&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether asking a domain expert a question about their data or assigning students a task, giving a brief explanation of why it matters / what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for often yields better outcomes (e.g., information or students&amp;rsquo; work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially in statistical consulting settings, leading with intent can be used to gracefully assess a domain expert&amp;rsquo;s knowledge of statistics / coding, which then facilitates giving explanations and advice tailored to their level of understanding. In teaching, this is referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;zone of proximal development&lt;/strong&gt;: information and skills that a learner can realistically assimilate into their mental framework in the near term, given what they already know. When starting work in a new area of application, a statistician also must learn on the fly. A technique that we practiced frequently in Statistical Collaboration was to pause after a domain expert&amp;rsquo;s explanation and, instead of immediately moving on to the next thing, &lt;strong&gt;summarize back our understanding&lt;/strong&gt; of what they said. This helps to catch and rectify misconceptions of both the goals and technical details of a project early on, before it becomes burdensome to correct course. Similarly, asking a domain expert or a student to explain out loud (or in writing) what they took away from one of my explanations is a great way to check whether they understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, a big takeaway for me from both Statistical Collaboration and Teaching 100 is that working with other people is so much more effective and enjoyable when one is familiar with well-tested strategies for doing so. Of course, there is always a chance of unforeseen circumstances that require ad hoc responses. But from my experience and countless stories from others, it seems like a large amount of professional stress is predictable and avoided by consistently implementing existing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;broad-musings-about-modern-education&#34;&gt;Broad Musings about Modern Education&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on the theme of interpersonal skills, in Teaching 100 our main project was to design a syllabus for a course, and I noticed that many of us in the class chose topics meant to address the &amp;ldquo;soft side&amp;rdquo; of our technical disciplines, such as statisticians working with domain experts or doctors working with patients. Traditionally, at least in STEM, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been much formal training along these lines. Skills in professional communication and/or teaching are often undervalued (e.g. in academic tenure review) and it is mostly expected that people either mimic their advisors / managers or figure it out on their own through trial and error. Especially given the self-selection of many people who have natural affinity for social interaction into other fields, it makes sense that classroom educators might try to fill this gap more systematically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as medicine in particular seems to have known for a long time, professional interpersonal skills are very difficult to learn in only a classroom setting. But outside the classroom, it is harder for educators to actually observe and guide their students&amp;rsquo; improvement. If the instructor of a statistical consulting course doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the time / compensation to sit through client meetings with every one of their students, then they (and their students) must have a certain amount of confidence in the students&amp;rsquo; skills to venture forth and report back. This becomes less realistic the more students are in the class and/or the more variation in the students&amp;rsquo; skill levels. I have yet to arrive at a conclusion about how best to deal with this tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent events appear to have made interpersonal skills more important than ever. The emergence of tools such as ChatGPT largely level the playing field for many writing-centric tasks, including composition of cover letters. My suspicion is that live interviews and collaboration skills will become ever more important in hiring for professional positions, in addition to promotions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To provide a sense of what I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on other than my research in the National Studies on Air Pollution &amp;amp; Health Group and Earth Lab, here is a list of my most substantial projects that resulted in course papers but not peer-reviewed publications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewed state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigated the usefulness of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for estimating
uncertainty in wildfire smoke prediction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explored methods to deal with measurement error (noise) in longitudinal (correlated) data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used distributed lag nonlinear models to investigate associations between air pollution and mortality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explored the evolution of discourse surrounding global public health surveillance and
information systems, including future opportunities and risks in implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used network methods, spatial and socioeconomic data to model migration between U.S. cities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used data assimilation methods to model seasonal flu cases in Denver, CO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used spatial kriging to improve estimation of air quality from a random forest model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used satellite imagery to analyze trends in air quality over Southeast Asia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used a hierarchical model and change-point analysis to predict energy usage from
temperature in U.S. cities. &lt;em&gt;My model was the class’s most accurate on unseen data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used a convolutional neural network to predict sociodemographic information based on
satellite images of US cities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Our successes and failures alike in getting these systems to do &amp;lsquo;what we want,&amp;rsquo; it turns out, offer us an unflinching, revelatory mirror.” - Brian Christian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer, I joined a data science &amp;amp; society-themed book club sponsored by the Harvard Data Science Initiative. Our first book was &lt;em&gt;The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values&lt;/em&gt; by Brian Christian (2020). It turned out to be one of my favorite nonfiction books. Someone in the group also let us know about a free virtual event, the Symposium on Interpretable and Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, hosted by the National Academies of Science Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics, which I ended up attending. (If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this Symposium, a recording is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/06-21-2022/interpretable-and-explainable-ai-and-machine-learning&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the reading, the Symposium, and our book club&amp;rsquo;s weekly discussions, there are a plethora of topics about which I could wax lyrical. For the sake of a bite-sized post, however, I will stick to a few overarching themes that stuck out to me: (1) the development of artificial intelligence (AI) giving us insights into our own brains, (2) the ability (or lack thereof) for individual people or minority groups to pursue justice for maltreatment at the &amp;ldquo;hands&amp;rdquo; of an algorithm, and (3) the perpetual need for humility (for both humans and AI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;similarities-and-differences-between-machine-and-human-learning&#34;&gt;Similarities and Differences Between Machine and Human Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alignment Problem&lt;/em&gt; steps through many key developments in AI, with lots of fun anecdotes to help readers peek behind the publication curtain to see what researchers were thinking and struggling with. This progression really helped me to see why, for instance, animals (including us) require both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations (e.g. hunger and curiosity) to thrive in a variety of environments. I&amp;rsquo;m also now able to articulate both the benefits and potential consequences of imitation: you can learn things that would otherwise be really difficult to explain or craft incentives for, but it may not work out if you attempt to copy something that you&amp;rsquo;re not equipped to do and/or don&amp;rsquo;t understand the motivations for. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to ever surpass the teacher if you&amp;rsquo;re just trying to match them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I see a lot of parallels to my personal experience learning to play the clarinet, which is by far my most structured extended learning experience. When you start out, you cling to the rules (of instrument technique and music in general) for dear life in an attempt to get off the ground: you try to do exactly what your teacher tells you, use a metronome to keep time and a tuner to check pitch. Eventually, it helps to have less of this internal rigidity and to start paying more attention to what feels right, trying to follow the &amp;ldquo;flow&amp;rdquo; of the music. Throughout this process, having a teacher to imitate and/or listening to recordings of other people playing can help you progress by leaps and bounds. At the same time, you likely won&amp;rsquo;t be able to play a piece as quickly or with as great a dynamic range as your teacher, and it will often sound worse if you try to mimic them in these ways right off the bat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cool development in AI has been the emergence of techniques to train AI against themselves, which I eventually recognized as a version of my clarinet teacher&amp;rsquo;s motto that the goal of taking lessons was to become my own best teacher (either in real-time or by recording and then listening to myself). A final memorable example of AI-human similarities in The Alignment Problem detailed how the development of an algorithm that allowed a computer to learn from changes in its expectation about the future (termed Temporal Difference Learning) ended up closely describing how our brains produce dopamine (a &amp;ldquo;happy hormone&amp;rdquo;), which was a huge breakthrough for neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all these similarities, there are also many ways that machine and human learning differ. For instance, &amp;ldquo;saliency&amp;rdquo; methods have shown that when some AI are trying to classify images as dogs or not-dogs, they are often looking at features like the blurriness of the outline of the object/subject in the middle of the image, as opposed to humans tending to look at the overall shape. This causes problems if we want to be able to interpret the output from algorithms: forcing computers to use our ontologies (language/thinking structure) might facilitate our understanding but prevent superhuman inference and/or be stymied by competing human ontologies**.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, regarding the earlier point about Temporal Difference Learning: although encountering observations that conflict with our mental models offers great learning opportunities, people often resist changing our opinions, sometimes even ignoring new data instead of doing the hard cognitive work of updating our expectations. In this way, we probably don&amp;rsquo;t want AI to be too similar to human cognitive behavior. On the flip side, while certain strategies developed for guiding the behavior of AI might be applicable to humans, they may not necessarily be good for us. For example, in the book club we discussed how gamifying various aspects of our lives can in some cases be helpful (e.g. rewarding ourselves for getting work done) but in other cases are harmful (e.g. becoming addicted to video games because they are more immediately satisfying than real life).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;actionable-recourse-for-algorithmic-injustice&#34;&gt;Actionable Recourse for Algorithmic Injustice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last six years, there has been an explosion of research and discussion about algorithmic bias against certain groups of people. Before reading The Alignment Problem, I actually hadn&amp;rsquo;t realized how young this field is because I started college in 2016, so I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about it my whole academic career. Now, in 2022, it seems like there are hundreds of different definitions of algorithmic fairness, along with mathematical theory showing that you can&amp;rsquo;t obtain them all at the same time, except possibly under very specific (unrealistic) conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the really interesting issues that my partner (who just graduated from law school) and I were talking about, and that then came up in the Symposium, is the lack of legal infrastructure for dealing with decisions made (or strongly informed) by algorithms. For instance, the US legal system currently allows appeal for decisions made by a biased jury, but not by a biased algorithm. Financial institutions are somewhat more regulated in how they may use models to inform lending decisions. However, as Patrick Hall (a professor at George Washington University) noted: even if, for instance, people are entitled to some notice of a few key features that factored into why they were denied a loan, this may be wildly insufficient for explaining an individual prediction from a (potentially proprietary) high-dimensional, nonlinear machine learning model that was designed to make the company profits when the results are averaged across all their clients. This is to say, we have a long way to go in truly providing individuals with actionable recourse against algorithms. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more on this topic, I&amp;rsquo;m linking some resources at the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cultivating-uncertainty&#34;&gt;Cultivating Uncertainty(?)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the panel discussion at the Symposium, a common scientific concept was raised: the more independent teams/models arrive at the same conclusion, the more reason to trust in that conclusion. This intuition motivates a general technique that researchers have started using to quantify the uncertainty of AI: generate a lot of results from different models or by perturbing the same model in different ways (e.g. cutting off different parts of the model from contributing to each prediction), and see how similar all the results are to each other. More spread indicates more uncertainty in the model prediction. (Side thought: time will tell whether quantification of model uncertainty ends up playing a role in people&amp;rsquo;s recourse from AI-based decisions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this approach really only works if all the models / sub-models are sufficiently distinct or independent of one another. In &lt;em&gt;The Alignment Problem&lt;/em&gt;, Christian describes how the Effective Altruism movement (see &amp;ldquo;On Having an Impact, Part 1&amp;rdquo;) struggles with maintaining moral uncertainty (i.e. for what global causes to focus attention and resources on) while simultaneously distributing educational resources and encouraging discussion between people all around the world. Similarly, while the push for open science / reproducibility and transparent decision making has many benefits, including increased methodological scrutiny and less duplicated work, it seems that there may be some downsides to encouraging everyone to do things the exact same way, using the exact same tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In data science, for instance, using the same packages in R or Python streamlines analyses, but could also potentially produce less evidence across multiple studies on the same topic because the work is not being done independently. This would of course be most concerning if a commonly-used package had a mistake in it, but even if the methods were all correct, the convenience of using a ready-made package might result in the community missing out on other ways to think about a problem that would provide different insights. Similarly, if the vast majority of publicly available datasets are biased towards white males, a consensus across these datasets is not necessarily a better representation of the population overall. (Note: I&amp;rsquo;m certainly not arguing for a return to siloed and/or poorly documented workflows &amp;ndash; just trying to articulate a point that I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard mentioned as much compared to the huge push for open science.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we thought we had a robust uncertainty estimate, maintaining a heightened sense of humility is especially important for AI because we want to avoid a situation in which the machines are no longer amenable to human input. Private and/or public sector creators of AI systems might also want machines to be even more careful than human actors would be for many practical applications, as they will often be judged more harshly by the public (and potentially, in the future, by the law). For an example of this, I&amp;rsquo;ll draw from &lt;em&gt;The Alignment Problem&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s description of the relationship between uncertainty and impact: if a self-driving car is unsure whether there&amp;rsquo;s a person in the road in front of it, then the best course of action is to slow down so as to minimize adverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize: on her concluding presentation slide at the Symposium, Been Kim (a research scientist at Google Brain) wrote, &amp;ldquo;One of the biggest challenges [in interpreting/explaining AI] is to resist building trust and be skeptical.&amp;rdquo; I believe she meant this in the context of humans interpreting a single model, but the sentiment could also easily be applied to humans interpreting ensembles of dependent models and/or data, as well as to AI continuing to make decisions after being deployed for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am far from being an expert in these topics, but I hope that my rambles have left you with some interesting thoughts and/or whetted your appetite to go learn more from people who&amp;rsquo;ve studied these issues in depth. My overarching takeaways from all of this are that (1) there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of interesting work being done in this field, (2) there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to do to ensure AI systems live up to our ideals, (3) we have the opportunity to learn a lot about ourselves along the way, and (4) as whizzy as our tech gets, humanity will need to stay humble to avoid losing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Principled Negotiation and the Ethos of Public Health</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/public-health-ethos/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/public-health-ethos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently reading a book on negotiation called &lt;em&gt;Getting to Yes&lt;/em&gt;, written by members of the Harvard Negotiation Project. One of the opening chapters describes positional bargaining: two sides starting from places of disagreement and inching their way closer by making small concessions in turn. The authors describe how problematic this process is: it is inefficient, commonly leads to unwise outcomes (good for neither side), and can harm relationships between parties. Instead, the book presents a case for principled negotiation, founded on separating the people (negotiators) from the problem, focusing on interests instead of positions, inventing options for mutual gain, and insisting on use of objective criteria. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/principled-negotiation-focus-interests-create-value/&#34;&gt;Here is a nice summary&lt;/a&gt;, for those interested in learning more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this book up to motivate presentation of my principles. Nearly everything we do in our professional and personal lives is a negotiation of some kind. It is important to establish what we believe so that we can work with others to identify common ground and develop pragmatic solutions to our problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to the news and having conversations with other people, it is clear that there are foundationally diverse beliefs about how human civilization should look, and how we should get there (if the belief is that we aren&amp;rsquo;t already there). I have come to the unoriginal conclusion that the largest discrepancy in how people think and act is described by the weight an individual mentally assigns to their personal freedoms in comparison with the freedoms of others, and to what extent they believe we should rely on governmental authorities to enforce the balance of individuals&amp;rsquo; freedoms. This discrepancy has obvious ties to the arena of public health, where large and complex problems such as infectious diseases and environmental pollution bring tensions between individual freedoms and collective sacrifice to light. In fact, while pondering my beliefs and their implications, I ran across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apha.org/-/media/files/pdf/membergroups/ethics/code_of_ethics.ashx&#34;&gt;Public Health Code of Ethics&lt;/a&gt; by the American Public Health Association (APHA) and determined this to be the most clear articulation of my principles that I have ever found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an excerpt from this Code of Ethics [page 3, bolding is mine], defining what it means for humans to flourish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Flourishing does not focus so much on biological function as on &lt;strong&gt;the social conditions of capability and opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; upon which health itself and many other goods depend. Flourishing refers to what individuals and communities experience when institutional and cultural structures create the opportunity for people to realize a wide range of potential capabilities inherent in all human beings. Flourishing occurs when &lt;strong&gt;capabilities for agency, creativity, intelligence, understanding, emotional engagement, and other positive human potentialities take shape in the form of lives well lived&lt;/strong&gt;. As such, we take a life course perspective that examines public health issues from maternal and child health into old age while &lt;strong&gt;recognizing specific vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt; at the extremes of age. The term human flourishing also underscores the &lt;strong&gt;relational interdependence&lt;/strong&gt; among human beings, which is expressed in virtually all social and cultural activity and fits well with the contemporary understanding of the social determinants of health. &lt;strong&gt;The preconditions of everyone’s health are communal and systemic&lt;/strong&gt;, and the field of public health must address them as such. Human flourishing is thus consonant with a social-relational, rather than an exclusively individualistic, interpretation of key values such as human rights, liberty, equality, and social and environmental justice that play a vital role in contemporary public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposite of human flourishing is&lt;/strong&gt; not only disease or ill health but also domination, inequity, discrimination, exploitation, exclusion, suffering, and despair: in a word, &lt;strong&gt;the stultification and denial of optimal human self-realization and thriving human communities.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this definition, it is clear that public health is all about giving people opportunities to live fulfilling lives. In fact, it seems that the goal is to maximize individual freedoms, within the bounds of not denying other individuals their freedoms. Later in this document, there is also an explicit discussion of responsibilities towards future generations and other organisms in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognize that these statements may all seem abstract. However, I think that before moving to more specific examples, we need to identify foundational points of agreement, such as the preciousness of self-realization. Then, we can build upon those foundations and deal with higher-level disagreements (e.g. differences in perspective about how we best allow people to self-realize) as they come. In the midst of extreme political polarization and ever-increasing complexity of societal problems, I believe that this kind of principled negotiation is necessary to develop a modern society that is just and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you too are someone who is interested in helping address large and complex issues in our society, I encourage you to articulate: what are your principles?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advice for the COMAP MCM/ICM</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/mcm-advice/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/mcm-advice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2017, 2018, and 2019, a team of two friends and I participated in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.comap.com/contests/mcm-icm&#34;&gt;Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP) International Mathematical / Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM)&lt;/a&gt;. The basic idea of the contest is that over 99 hours, a team of three undergrads is tasked with choosing one of six open-ended questions, building some kind of mathematical model, and writing a paper synthesizing their findings along with external research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the three years, my team&amp;rsquo;s projects spanned topics from happiness economics to the political impacts of climate change to the spread of the opioid epidemic. After being named one of the 36 winners (out of more than 25,000 teams worldwide) in 2019, I feel qualified to give out some advice for this contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t dive too much into the logistics, but preparing for the contest does make things run more smoothly. Pick out a place to work with your team where you won&amp;rsquo;t be distracted, where you have easy access to food and bathrooms, etc. Decide ahead of time what platforms you&amp;rsquo;re going to use to collaborate with your team (e.g. Overleaf, Google Docs, etc.). Plan ahead with school work / get excused from attending lecture so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about other responsibilities during the contest. Start the weekend well-rested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of tips that are more specific to how my team and I approached this contest. Clearly ours is not the only way to go, but if you&amp;rsquo;re on this site, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that you and I have some things in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a problem for which at least someone on your team has a personal and/or educational affinity. Starting from scratch (no background knowledge) makes it a lot harder to be creative and write a compelling paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having an interdisciplinary team dramatically increases the odds that at least one of your team members will have an affinity for at least one of the topics, and facilitates division of labor throughout the contest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground your project with lots of external information. Throughout your paper, reference theory (from both the social and natural sciences, depending on the problem) to motivate your modeling choices and compare your results with real statistics. Just remember to include a reference for EVERYTHING.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t try to learn much (if any) new math or computational techniques. You can go far with simple tools, and struggling to understand new concepts is time-intensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridging concepts across fields (especially ones with which one or more of your team members is already familiar) is a nice way of coming up with a novel solution that&amp;rsquo;s not too technically complex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocate plenty of time for writing and editing. A well-written paper (including the summary sheet) is crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun with it! Your paper doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be dry like many scientific journals &amp;ndash; in fact, the more creative you are, the more your paper will stick out to judges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persevere :) The more years you attempt this contest, the more strategies you&amp;rsquo;ll have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life gets busy and it can be hard to find the time and motivation to sit down and read nonfiction.
