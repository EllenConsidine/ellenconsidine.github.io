      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the roles I undertook as Vice-President of the Harvard graduate student science policy group was co-organizing a series of events at the intersection of climate &amp;amp; health. This brought together students and staff from across the Harvard School of Public Health, Medical School, Dental School, and Graduate School of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences. In particular, I spearheaded and moderated a panel and networking dinner focused on the translation of research into policy.&lt;/p&gt;
