      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are descriptions of the three full-semester courses that I helped teach at HSPH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spring-2024-bst-226-applied-longitudinal-analysis&#34;&gt;Spring 2024: BST 226, Applied Longitudinal Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approx. number of students: 100
Course description: This course covers modern methods for the analysis of repeated measures, correlated outcomes and longitudinal data, including the unbalanced and incomplete data sets characteristic of biomedical research. Topics include an introduction to the analysis of correlated data, analysis of response profiles, fitting parametric curves, covariance pattern models, random effects and growth curve models, and generalized linear models for longitudinal data, including generalized estimating equations (GEE) and generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fall-2023-bst-210-applied-regression-analysis&#34;&gt;Fall 2023: BST 210, Applied Regression Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approx. number of students: 75
Course description: Topics include model interpretation, model building, and model assessment for linear regression with continuous outcomes, logistic regression with binary outcomes, and proportional hazards regression with survival time outcomes. Specific topics include regression diagnostics, confounding and effect modification, goodness of fit, data transformations, splines and additive models, ordinal, multinomial, and conditional logistic regression, generalized linear models, overdispersion, Poisson regression for rate outcomes, hazard functions, and missing data. The course provides students with the skills necessary to perform regression analyses and to critically interpret statistical issues related to regression applications in the public health literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fall-2021-bst-222-basics-of-statistical-inference&#34;&gt;Fall 2021: BST 222, Basics of Statistical Inference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approx. number of students: 75
Course description: This course provides a basic yet thorough introduction to the probability theory and mathematical statistics that underlie many of the commonly used techniques in public health research. Topics covered include probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson), means, variances and expected values, finite sampling distributions, parameter estimation (method of moments, maximum likelihood), confidence intervals, hypothesis testing (likelihood ratio, Wald and score tests). All theoretical material are motivated with problems from epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health and other public health areas. This course is aimed towards second year doctoral students in fields other than Biostatistics. Background in algebra and calculus required.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To provide a sense of what I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on other than my research in the National Studies on Air Pollution &amp;amp; Health Group and Earth Lab, here is a list of my most substantial projects that resulted in course papers but not peer-reviewed publications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewed state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigated the usefulness of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for estimating
uncertainty in wildfire smoke prediction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explored methods to deal with measurement error (noise) in longitudinal (correlated) data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used distributed lag nonlinear models to investigate associations between air pollution and mortality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explored the evolution of discourse surrounding global public health surveillance and
information systems, including future opportunities and risks in implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used network methods, spatial and socioeconomic data to model migration between U.S. cities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used data assimilation methods to model seasonal flu cases in Denver, CO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used spatial kriging to improve estimation of air quality from a random forest model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used satellite imagery to analyze trends in air quality over Southeast Asia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used a hierarchical model and change-point analysis to predict energy usage from
temperature in U.S. cities. &lt;em&gt;My model was the classâ€™s most accurate on unseen data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used a convolutional neural network to predict sociodemographic information based on
satellite images of US cities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
